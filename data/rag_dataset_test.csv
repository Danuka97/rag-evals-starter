We are a small all volunteer NGO Humanity Road has been instrumental in helping us achieve our objectives. They are a first class ethical organization.
Thank you Humanity Road for helping us help others.
Captain Mark Drewelow
Founder, YachtAid Global.
Have had a brief time working with Humanity Road and must say the people are amazing. They very much care about the world and the events that affect others around the world. I have been very thankful to have met them and continue to work with them in many aspects. thank you for the great work all of you do.
Humanity Road (HR) is a unique not for profit organisation that remain steadfast and focused on what they are good at - 'closing the black hole of communication' by linking disaster affected communities to the emergency response organisations.
As a volunteer, i can attest to the fact that at Humanity Road, they matched words with action. In fact, i witnessed a moment where HR volunteers monitored three tropical storms, three hurricanes, two earthquakes and two disaster exercise within 48 hours.
HR volunteers are always eager to provide help, train volunteers and make a difference.!
I have worked with HumanityRoad for a number of years. During this time, I have managed a number of disasters and planned events.
Humanity Road has consistently been involved on a global scale while maintaining their interest in what happens locally.
Humanity Road is an excellent Non-Profit.
As a student , the ways in which I am being benefitted from being a part of this organization are:-
1) Practical and global exposure to what I am learning in class
2)Work at my convenience
3) Systematic training provided periodically or as per request.
After Hurricane Sandy in NYC our team of designers had a chance to work with Humanity Road, who were in the midst of supporting the most vulnerable citizens in New York City. HR gave us invaluable information about the immediate needs of rescue workers in a crises. Our product development benefitted greatly. They have continued to support and help our efforts by connecting us to people in different countries that do first responder work. HR are organized, compassionate and up to date with communication strategies and needs for emergency workers.
Humanity Road is a dedicated non-profit with a global volunteer network. Their training, tools, and support are fantastic and the volunteers are vigilant in producing accurate and reliable information during times of disaster and crisis. With Humanity Road there will always be someone there to respond and help those in need!
Humanity Road fills a unique niche in the demand for digital information around the globe when disaster strikes. No one provides such vital detailed information during times of crisis as Humanity Road. The efficiency and effectiveness of this organization is simply outstanding. I urge you to find a way to support them with donations or exposure. Find them on Facebook, like them and share Humanity Road's page.
Humanity Road is a very special organization driven by very special people. I joined the team as a volunteer in the wake of the recent Nepal earthquake. Since then, I have been trained in various activities of the organization. I have realized that Humanity Road fills a critical gap between formal disaster response systems and real-time deployments. Using technology as an essential tool, Humanity Road has been of commendable service in situations where prompt interventions are needed. The work they do is outstanding, and the dedication of the team to an urgent need is remarkable.
As an expert in HADR Radio Communications I truly understand the power of swift and clear communications. Humanity Road is one of the most inspiring and relevant non profits that exist in this sector today. Their obvious passion for helping people during the humanitarian disasters is equal only to the extraordinary results they achieve when they ""deploy"". The aggregated data that is collected via the various sources of social media they analyse helps guide the big organisations more efficiently in helping the affected people. However they also live and die by the adage that they must always keep the human in humanitarian relief, it may all be online but it always more about the people.
As a Pacific Disaster Center representative I worked with Humanity Road (HR) staff in an exercise environment supporting a multination disaster response exercise. The HR staff were clearly experts in their field. PDC looks forward working with HR in the future on real or exercise environment disaster response.
Respectfully,
Lara Payne

HR is working in an Industry Consortium called the Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC) to advance interoperability in our Rapid Response Incubator. These efforts hope someday to enable all parties involved in disasters, from victims to governments, front line to back office, even gamers and social networkers, to operate at their best in a secure-enough fashion to speed and lower the cost of response. Remember, we could all become the victims at any moment, if things go badly. HR is there, wherever there is..

"One of two convicted killers who escaped from an upstate New York maximum-security prison was killed Friday by law enforcement officers near the Canadian border, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Richard Matt was killed, Cuomo said. David Sweat's whereabouts are unknown.
“We have no reason to believe that Mr. Sweat was not with Mr. Matt at that time [of the shooting], but we don't have any confirming evidence that he was, either,” the governor said. “There are several leads that are being tracked down as we speak.”
Matt was killed in a wooded area in the town of Malone, about 40 miles west of Dannemora, where the prison is located, according to officials. Both towns are near the Canadian border.
New York State Police Supt. Joseph D'Amico said Matt was ""shot dead"" by a tactical team from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
""We recovered a 20-gauge shotgun from Matt's body at the location,"" D'Amico said.
Matt did not shoot at police during the encounter, authorities said.
""They verbally challenged him, told him to put up his hands. And at that time, he was shot when he didn't comply,"" D'Amico said.
Matt was tracked down after a motorist reported about 1:51 p.m. that someone shot at their camper near Route 30, according to authorities.
A cabin in the area of the shooting was searched and police found evidence that a gun had been fired inside and someone had recently left, D'Amico said. While searching the nearby woods, authorities heard coughs, which is when they encountered and killed Matt, D'Amico said.
Authorities continue to search the area for Sweat, D'Amico said.
""We have no actual sighting of Sweat by law enforcement, but we have no indication that Sweat wasn’t accompanying Matt at the time that he was shot and killed, so we’re going to maintain the perimeter that we have,” D'Amico said.
Both men had been on the run since they were found missing from the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6.
Authorities have followed up on more than 2,400 leads, D'Amico said.
Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes. They made a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall and squirmed through pipes.
Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole for killing a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for killing and dismembering his former boss.
The search for the escaped inmates sparked a search that extended to the Mexican border and involved hundreds of law enforcement officials, including local police and FBI agents.
The news follows a flurry of possible sightings by reported residents in rural areas of New York, both near the prison and hundreds of miles away near the Pennsylvania border.
A strong lead came this week, when someone reported a burglary at a cabin about 20 miles from the prison. New York State Police seized items from the cabin to test for DNA and said evidence indicated the men ""may have spent time"" in the cabin.
Matt, 48, and Sweat, 35, tricked correctional officers at the prison by making dummies and stuffing them into their beds the night they fled. They were discovered missing at a 5:30 a.m. bed check on June 6.
Officials have said the men used power tools to cut through metal and brick walls and pipes, and then made their way via underground pipes to a manhole a few hundred feet from the prison walls. They emerged from the manhole and fled.
A civilian prison employee, Joyce Mitchell, was arrested June 12 and charged with a felony and a misdemeanor on allegations of smuggling hacksaw blades, chisels, a hole punch and a screwdriver bit into the prison to help the men escape. Mitchell has pleaded not guilty.
A second arrest was made Wednesday evening. Prison guard Gene Palmer faces charges including promoting prison contraband and tampering with physical evidence.
A $100,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the escapees' arrest.
Matt and Sweat defied the odds in remaining at large so long, according to prison escape data compiled by the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Between 2002 and 2012, of the 29 inmates who escaped from New York state prisons, all were caught within three days.
Serrano reported from Washington and Parker from Los Angeles. Times staff writers Tina Susman, Matt Pearce, Christine Mai-Duc, James Queally contributed to this report.

(Thirty years later…)
“Hannah, come here. Quickly, now!” I yelled. I was weary, and could not bear to call for my child another time. My husband, Michael, was several towns away, looking for work to provide for our family. We were married twenty-five years ago, and have only two children. Hannah and Isaac are good children, though they are often disrespectful and rude. I was nearly past my child-bearing years, and I wished desperately that we had been able to have more children. But God must not have meant it to be so, and I tried to remain content.
For some reason, however, I was always angry about something, and I could not do anything about the bitterness that I carried about within me. Deep inside, I knew that it stemmed from my jealousy of Mary. She had given birth to the “Savior” and he seemed like a perfectly normal child. There was nothing special about him. Although he is grown now, I have yet to see him save the world. Mary had gone on to have eight more children, and I was jealous of her ability to have such a wonderful family.
I have not talked to Mary since that fateful day when she told me of her pregnancy. I let myself stay angry at her, and, even now, I have no intention of forgiving her. What she did was just too wrong for me to let go of. Do I carry a grudge? Perhaps, but she deserves it.
Hannah finally came in from outside, her face red from the cold. She went straight to the fire and began warming her hands and cheeks. I watched my daughter and thought to myself how beautiful she was. Nearly twelve, she was nearing the age of womanhood, when she would think of marrying and leaving me. I tried not to think about it, but I did know that it was inevitable.
“Why were you calling me, Mama?” she asked. “I need you to find Isaac for me. I haven’t seen him all morning,” I said. Hannah nodded and went off in search of her brother. Isaac was forever getting into trouble, though it seemed that trouble usually found him. I sighed at the thought of bringing up such a rambunctious boy, but I knew that Michael was teaching Isaac how to be a man. Though he was only seven, he had a love for life that I admired.
When I watched Isaac laugh so joyously, it made me realize that something inside of me had died; the part that loved life and looked for the good in every situation. Bitterness and anger had become such a part of my routine, that I did not even try to change my ways.
“Mama!” came the cry from outside. I pulled a shawl over my shoulders and hurried outside to see what was the matter. Hannah was hunched over something in our field, and I ran over to see who it was.
It was Isaac. Nearly frozen, he lay collapsed on the ground huddled in a ball. I felt his forehead. It was a fever higher than I had ever felt before.
“No,” I breathed. It couldn’t be my Isaac. My beautiful, lively boy was laying there, closer to death than I had ever seen before. “Hannah! Run and fetch someone. The doctor. Someone!” I yelled. Hannah’s frightened face melted my heart, and I lay a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. As she ran off, I lifted my sweet boy into my arms and carried him inside. I wrapped him in blankets and tried to get him to drink water, but all he could do was moan and tremble.
My son was dying.
Hannah came running back with a man I had not seen in a long while.
It was Jesus. The man who I had come to loathe.
“What are you doing here?!” I screamed. Jesus looked at me calmly, taking my hand and leading me to a chair. I could not speak. Why was he being so kind to me? He went over to Isaac and sat on the pallet next to him. He took my son’s hand and looked at him with a tenderness I had never seen before. Part of me wanted to scream at him to stop touching my boy, but something inside of me stopped and I watched in wonder as he breathed words that I could not hear into Isaac’s ear. What seemed like only a moment later, a short gasp came from Isaac’s lips, and his eyes fluttered open. I hastened to his bedside, and looked into his face.
His fever had broken.
I looked at Jesus in bewilderment, and he looked back at me with eyes that told of something I had never seen before. I still do not know what it was, but I do know that it was something I had never seen in a man here on earth. I looked up to thank Jesus, but he had already gone, slowly shutting the door and leaving without expecting any thanks.
My bitter heart melted only slightly, and I realized that maybe I could be wrong. Months later, I had come to think of the miracle as only a coincidence. Jesus had only been there at the exact moment Isaac’s fever had broken. It wasn’t his doing. It was luck. Chance. Coincidence.
My heart hardened even further, and I thought that nothing could break through the wall I had built around my heart. Nothing could touch me and erase the bitterness encasing my ability to forgive.
Nothing could break me.

"Hong Kong’s banking industry—like the rest of the world’s—has become a lot less exciting, more closely scrutinized and often less lucrative for its one-time rainmakers. As a result, executives from the cloistered confines of banking are doing something that would have been unthinkable, even horrifying, just a decade ago: starting their own businesses.
Banking is a “very different field” than it was before the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Loong, an ex-Citibank and Standard Chartered manager who founded the peer-to-peer lending platform WeLend in 2012. Banks are less generous about compensation, have reined in their spending and growth plans, and are not encouraging bankers to innovate: “It’s not as fun as before.”
Rather than leaving Hong Kong in search of the next banking hot-spot, a growing number of finance pros like Loong have started businesses, from last-minute hotel booking websites to crowd-funding groups to organic farms. The career-hopping has helped push start-ups to 16% of new investments in Hong Kong last year, from 11% in 2010, Bloomberg reported today.
In many cases, they’re going directly after their old employers’ business. WeLend, which aims to cut out the “expensive middlemen” in lending (aka banks and bankers), now has over 3,500 members, and has made over HK$195 million in loans with a team that includes former bankers from HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Bank of Montreal. James Giancotti, a former Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan banker, has attracted more than 900 backers for his crowd-funding company BigColors. Often, these funders are other bankers still at big financial firms he said, looking for their “ticket out of banking,” he told Bloomberg.
These finance-focused start-ups help explain why despite several ho-hum years for banking in Hong Kong, jobs in the broader finance sector accounted for 19% (pdf, pg 2) of Hong Kong’s overall employment in 2012, up from 16% (pdf) in 2007—an increase of 151,000 jobs.
Hong Kong is rich with foreign bankers who arrived with a multinational corporation and then stayed on after the job disappeared or became less appealing, in thrall with the easy climate, high quality of life (pollution notwithstanding) and the low tax rates. “I thought I’d be here for three years, but it has been 15,” is a common expat refrain; many parents even send their kids to boarding school in their home country while they stay in Hong Kong.
Jumping to a start-up means forgoing the fancy hotels and business class flights of the banking industry, but in Hong Kong it doesn’t always mean taking a massive pay cut. WeLab pays “competitively,” in part because it is hard to lure talent in Hong Kong with astronomical rents otherwise, Loong said—though he admits pay is “not our top attraction.” Bankers who make the jump are looking for an opportunity to “impact the future, and make a change in the field they know, which is finance,” he said.",What change has been observed in the banking industry in Hong Kong since the 2008 financial crisis?,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, the banking industry in Hong Kong has become less exciting, more scrutinized, and often less lucrative. As a result, many executives have started their own businesses. Banks are less generous about compensation, have reined in their spending and growth plans, and are not encouraging bankers to innovate."

When I converted to Islam nearly 8 years ago, I had no idea there were literally millions of Muslims in the world who are Muslim only in name.
Some one who calls themselves Muslim, but has no connection to their creator can be called a “Cultural Muslim”. Cultural Muslims wear hijab, for example, only because it’s a cultural demand in their family/society; they only pray at Eid prayers and only because it’s a family/cultural obligation. They fast one day of Ramadan to feel like they are part of the festivities, but otherwise have no connection with God on a deeper level.
The cultural Muslim is not unlike the “Christian” who my former pastor lovingly called part of the “CEM crowd”, or those who only attend church only on Christmas, Easter, and Mother’s Day.
Turns out, there are millions of Muslims who are only called such because their parents’ parents’ parents were practicing. “Muslim” has become synonymous with “good, kind person of Arab/Indian/Pakistani/Indo/Malay origin” in much the same way as “Christian” has become synonymous with “good, kind person who is American”.
New Muslims cannot imagine that a day will come that they themselves could become a Cultural Muslim. And yet, I am here to say: it can happen to anyone.
I realized I had become a Cultural Muslim when the day came that I had more fear and trepidation at the idea of removing my hijab than I did about skipping prayers.
The idea of removing my outer religious identity was more crippling than the idea of actually not being Muslim anymore. If faced with the choice to maintain my hijab but neglect my prayers, or remove my hijab for safety reasons in America (Trump), but maintain my prayers, I searched my heart and realized that I preferred the first option.
This, my friends, is a severe disease of the heart.
But why do I openly admit this to you, dear reader? Because too many converts come into Islam—and too many heritage Muslims start practicing Islam—with such zeal and fervor that they do not adequately prepare themselves for the day when the fervor flares out. I know because it happened to me.
It’s kind of like being in a formerly passionate marriage: when that passion has fizzled out, there must be something under the passion to keep the marriage alive and healthy, something deeper and more reliable than passion, lust, and infatuation.
Likewise, the day will come for all those who feel the zeal when, because of this reason or that reason, they will burn out and begin to question if they are still on the right path, and they will need to have something deeper than zeal to keep them going.
When this realization hit me like a ton of bricks, I took some time and really investigated the deeper issues inside. Ultimately, I came to understand these things, and maybe they will help you, too:
- People cannot save me when I face Allah. My dearest friends and spouse and children and parents will not even think of me on that day.  that day, {their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.} (Surat An-Nur, verse 24). {And they will say to their skin: ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say: ‘Allah has caused us to speak, as He cause all things to speak.’} (Surat Al-Fussillat, verse 21) I can just imagine my hijab, for example, speaking against me, saying “She wore me because it pleased her friends.” “She wore me because it pleased her husband.” “She wore me because it made her seem more pious.”
- The first thing Allah will ask me is about my prayer. Not my hijab. Not my education. Not my loyalty to my country or friends or family or tribe. First, my prayer. “The first thing the people will be accountable for on the Day of Judgment is prayer, Allah will say to His angels (even though he already knows) : “Look at my servants prayers. Were they complete or not?” […]” -Prophet Muhammad (Reported by Imams Ahmad, Abu Dawood, An-Nisa’i, and Al-Hakim)
- God will only accept my good deeds if I have a pure heart: {And disgrace me not on the Day when (all the creatures) will be resurrected; The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except him who brings to Allah a clean heart [clean from Shirk (polytheism) and Nifaq (hypocrisy)].} (Surah ash-Shu’ara, verses 87-89)
At the end of all things, it will only be my heart that saves me (or not), and what good will my struggling because of hijab or striving for my religion be if I did it to seem pious, or to please my family, or because I had finally found an identity to cling to and didn’t want to give it up?
I cannot willingly give up my soul while clinging tightly to my hijab and other outward shows of Islam. I cannot willingly toss aside all the work I have done on my heart by working to impress people around me rather than working to please All “Have I Become a Cultural Muslim?”

David gave her one hundred dollars a month, which Lous parents gratefully accepted, asking no questions. They imagined that she made a great deal more money than she actually did, because she told them that she did. They had fanciful and unrealistic notions about the salary level of a roving reporter and Lou let them hang on to those notions.

"Two days after my riot-run and I am primed for my LSD. In the morning I have nine miles to fuel for and run before midday. I eat cereal, toast, a banana and sit down for a couple of hours. Rain begins to fall. I never like stepping out into it, but love running in it once I am warm and calm – too long though, and the soles of your feet begin to wear away inside your shoes. I hope my feet don’t get too wet too quickly. London is still recovering after its nights of rioting so I head towards Peckham (where there have been riots) and adjacent Dulwich, Lady Thatcher’s old constituency, where there haven’t. But there is something wrong. By the time I reach the bottom of my road (about a hundred metres) my legs feel like they are running on some stability-testing fairground ride. I am breathing heavily. I turn the corner and outside the Riley’s snooker hall on the wide pavement there are sizeable dollops of horse shit. It is hard to think of a landscape less suitable for horse riding than the raging noise, metal and concrete of this junction. But here they must have been, crowd controlling Lewisham’s bottom feeders. Within half a mile I am beginning to think that I might be sick. In fact, for all the full stops in the rest of this post read thus: ‘and I still feel that I am about to puke’. I struggle through the first mile, convinced that the heaviness of my lungs and heart will pass at any moment .(. – and I still feel like I am about to puke).
Rain.
The weight of whatever it is sticks to me, hangs on me. I fight. I could cut this run to four miles, and sneak in this nine tomorrow, at some point – though I don’t know when. No, you came out for nine, that’s what you’ll do. Bing, mile three. Some boarded up shops and estate agents off Peckham Rye, but I’m not interested. Mile four. I feel like I am carrying a cannonball on my stomach. I am carrying water, which I HATE having to do, but I cannot drink any of it, feeling more stuffed than during post-prandial games on Christmas Day. So I have to carry the full bottle and I can hardly breathe my heart is beating so hard.
Into Dulwich and there are no signs of riot damage. I pass a bright blue and old-fashioned drop-crossbar ladies’ pushbike chained to a lamppost. It has had its front wheel stolen – I hubristically wonder if this is as bad as it got, here. But Dulwich has two things to say in return. One, no – and I know this because twenty yards on I can see a big queue outside a shop. The high street is deserted except for this. As I get closer, I see that it is not housewives queueing for rations in the 1940s, they are waiting their turn at the local locksmiths. Two, revenge. Leaving Dulwich and heading south, there is a huge hill. All of the miles so far have been run slower than 10 minutes. I climb this hill so slowly that I might have walked up it, backwards, at a faster pace. How have I got so far and held my breakfast down? The scene is suddenly offset by the sight of Enid Blyton’s house. It all seems so far away from the endless summer of her vision of England. Climb. Climb. Climb. I pass the Horniman Museum, a name that always makes me snigger for puerile reasons. Left, my head tells me this must be north. The sun in the sky is only a dim memory behind this thick concrete of cloud (and still I …). The hill cannot possibly continue further up, any higher and I will be through the cloud cover. Then, ahh, Mrs Jordan’s house. I always knew she was hidden away around here somewhere. Mrs Jordan was an actress in the early nineteenth century, and was the mistress of William IV, one of the two incompetent kings fathered by George III. The thought strikes me, could it be this horni-man that the museum is named for. My spirits obviously easing. The road slants away from me, slowly. It is a blissful sight. I am over an hour into the run, and although the nausea eases, it does not subside entirely. Now it is only helped by the slow and easeful pace aided by the curve down to Forest Hill.
This is the worst run I have done that did not end in, or was cut short by, injury. I made numerous mistakes. I ate too much. I went out too quickly. I ignored the fact that I was struggling. I was putting unnecessary strain on my heart. I could have brought on an asthma attack. Less fuel, more fun. But the most basic rule that I ignored was that the run was supposed to be an LSD. There is nothing about the concept of Long, Slow, Distance that fits with it being done in a hurry, being done in even a slightly curtailed timeframe. Instead, what I had done was fusion running. I had taken a Michelin starred dish of delightful LSD and remixed it as fast food. Of course the result was utterly nauseous.
How not to do LSD",What mistakes did the narrator make during his run?,"The narrator made several mistakes during his run. He ate too much before the run, he started running too quickly, he ignored the fact that he was struggling, he put unnecessary strain on his heart, and he could have triggered an asthma attack. He also ignored the basic rule of his run being an LSD (Long, Slow, Distance), and instead rushed it, which resulted in him feeling nauseous."
"Schneiderman op-ed: Legislature can still pass ethics reform this session
Updated 6:00 pm, Tuesday, May 26, 2015
Corruption in New York State government is hardly new. The infamous William M. ""Boss"" Tweed was a state senator during the worst of his crimes. More recently, at least 30 statewide elected officials and legislators have left office because of criminal or ethical problems since 2000.
But the charges against the leaders of both houses of the Legislature in a single session have made this year truly stand out — even in New York's long and inglorious history of public corruption.
Remarkably, after the governor and the new leaders of the Legislature met May 13, it became clear that ethics and campaign finance reform are not even on the agenda as the legislative session draws to a close. This glaring omission — if not corrected — would do a disservice to the lion's share of elected officials who are honorable public servants, tainted by the misconduct of the few.
The people of New York — 92 percent of whom now say corruption is a serious problem — expect and demand government and elected officials to put the public interest ahead of all else. Now is the time for real reform.
More Information
Eric T. Schneiderman is the 65th attorney general of New York state.
There are only two paths to meaningful change: fundamental reform of the system, or more investigations, arrests and prosecutions that further erode public confidence.
In the last four years, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and I have partnered to prosecute more than 60 officials and their cronies all across the state, at every level of government, who have abused the public trust. But the parade of arrests will not stop until our leaders take bold steps toward comprehensive reforms.
Fortunately, there is still time before the end of this year's legislative session to get the job done. That is why I intend to send a program bill to the Senate and the Assembly that includes a comprehensive package of changes that reformers, good government groups and the people of New York are demanding.
The reform blueprint I am proposing — proposals attack a system that cries out for change every time the public interest is ignored in Albany. For every voter who is angry about loopholes and exemptions that make New York tax code look like Swiss cheese; or the inability to pass legislation to prevent irretrievable damage to our environment; or the countless New Yorkers who are working full-time jobs but still living in poverty — the time has come to channel that anger into bold reform.
No one can claim the ideas in this bill are radical or partisan, or that they require exploration and inquiry that exceeds the time remaining before legislators leave Albany for the year.
We know what needs to change. There are three weeks left in this session. There are no more legitimate excuses not to act.",Who is the 65th attorney general of New York state?,Eric T. Schneiderman is the 65th attorney general of New York state.
"Why Reagonomics and other Voodoo Economics programs FAIL
Anyone who has seen firsthand the smoke and mirrors that came about during the Reagan years must now be screaming daily “I TOLD YOU SO!!!” Why? because it is patently OBVIOUS what happens when you pander to the Corporations and neglect the middle class, or the working classes. In a nuthsell, Reagan said, you give tax breaks to the rich, it will “trickle down” to the poor. Then Vice President Bush termed this “voodoo economics,” and history is proving him right…..
So, Reagan (even though you’re dead) pay attention because YOU WERE FRIGGING WRONG! The rich dont give a damn about the less fortunate, noblesse oblige is a relic, and giving the multinationals free reign and allowing them to offshore and downsize and outsource and close factories in towns all across America brought us to this: FOLKS WHO CANT PAY THEIR BILLS BECAUSE THE JOBS WENT AWAY….Then, you have the greedy lenders/bankers/mortgage industry….all to willing to throw caution to the winds and ignore the principles of sound lending….getting “creative” with interest rates and suckering in folks who foolishly forget to be prudent when they figure the cost of a home. One income or two? doesnt matter, let tomorrow take care of itself. We’ll delay the inevitable with a balloon payment and an ARM.
On top of the bailout (which was the SINGLE WORST ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE to befall this country, is it any wonder that:
AP ENTERPRISE: Federal tax revenues plummeting
By STEPHEN OHLEMACHER, Associated Press Writer Stephen Ohlemacher, Associated Press Writer – 2 hrs 47 mins‘s.
Well DUH boys and girls!! It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure this out!! you take away the jobs, (or allow them to go away) you lose tax revenue. Someone get a frigging taser, we need to wake up our so-called elected officials and get them to play HARDBALL with those happy-go-lucky corporations who have been sliding thanks to dumbass loopholes they acquired by lobbying and campaign financing and other nefarious means.
I hope and pray there is at least ONE legislator out there who is paying attention. At the end of the day, he/she may be the only one left standing….
.
??? I appreciate your commentary, but I’d appreciate it more if I understood it! I dont form my opinions lightly, and like you, I am over 50 years young. Ive seen this country go thru the Camelot years, the aftermath, the Watergate era, the gas crunch, the “trickle-down” 80’s, the dot com boom and the bubble burst and savings and loan debacle of the 90’s. Reagan’s policies didnt work. Giving the giant corporations breaks at the expense of the working joe was always a stupid way to do business. The chickens are now coming home to roost.
When you neglect your labor force, in pursuit of the almighty profit margin, you will eventually pay the price. I sincerely hope Obama starts penalizing big corporations who choose to relocate outside of the US. America was once great because we built all our own stuff, grew all our own food and giant companies were kept in check with oversight. This country already went thru a trustbusting phaze. You’d think we’d have learned by now…..",What was the main criticism of Reagan's economic policies according to the context?,"The main criticism of Reagan's economic policies, according to the context, was that they favored corporations and the rich at the expense of the middle and working classes. This was done through tax breaks for the rich, with the expectation that the benefits would ""trickle down"" to the poor. However, the context argues that this approach led to job losses, decreased tax revenue, and economic hardship for many people."

Hello!! I'm back with my card for this week's CASology challenge. The cue word this week is ""gift"". You can find all the details for the challenge here and our guest designer is the uber talented Hannelie. Don't forget... CASology is looking for some new team members. You have until December 15th to get your application in.
Another very simple card from me this week. When I saw the cue word I had only one idea in mind and that was to use a sentiment from the Hero Arts set Greatest Gift because you see to me Christmas really is only about the greatest gift ever given, Jesus. As simple and uncomplicated as that. I also didn't want to use a traditional Christmas color combo so I went instead with navy blue. I stamped the sentiment toward the bottom of cardstock and then stamped the star (from the companion Hero Arts set Heavens Rejoice) above the sentiment as you see. A clear rhinestone was added to the center. I also used my SU! Ticket Corner punch to punch the corners for a bit more interest.
Thanks for stopping by... make sure you check out the cards from the rest of the design team: Melissa, Tracey, Jen, Ardyth and this week's guest designer Hannelie, Can't wait to see what you come up with using this week's cue word!
Supplies: Cardstock: PTI white; SU! Night of Navy; Stamps: Hero Arts; Ink: SU! Night of Navy; Rhinestones: Stampin Up!; Punch: SU! Ticket Corner punch

"I had a really bad night. Just being exhausted doesn’t cause the world to stop. We didn’t have any rocket alerts, but apparently Israel is using concussion bombs, collapsing the tunnels that were built on the border of Gaza. I feel it and, it doesn’t help me sleep – for some reason.
I am noticing a new thing about myself in the midst of all of this fun and games. I don’t want to have anything to do with people who aren’t in the middle of all of this with me. I feel I have nothing in common with them, they annoy me. Friends call to see how I am and just want to hang up on them. I appreciate the consideration, but you see, you don’t get it. You can’t get it and I can’t explain it to you and I don’t have the energy to try because I need it all to keep going.
So I try not to be short tempered, I try not to be curt, and I try to get the *f* out of the conversations as quickly as possible because I just can’t cope. I want to say things like ‘if you aren’t helping then leave me alone,’ only, they are trying to help and it really isn’t like there is anything they can do.
But – I need to reserve my energy for the next tseva adom, for the next life-or-death decision of whether to drive out into the big scary world to buy a computer screen or some cables or some ground beef. I need to try and be present for my kids, who need something to lean on in the worst way in the middle of this. Not small children, barukh hashem, but children all the same, who need their mother so they can go on functioning, and for the adults, acting like adults.
It’s not that I’m not interested in other people’s problems. In fact, people saying they have nothing to complain about compared to me annoy me terribly. I’d love to hear something going on with somebody else that I could take an interest in, and if you are genuinely distressed I’d like to be able to help. It would be a nice contrast to the impotence of just sitting here listening to the ‘boom’s.
It’s a whole lot like people who tell me that after seeing me (in the wheelchair or whatever) they feel they don’t have any problems. WTF is up with that? My being a cripple doesn’t erase your problems any more than bombs being dropped around me. So don’t talk in that stupid way. You have your problems and I have mine, and we can identify with each other, empathise with each other, and support each other through the recognition that we are all hurt and hurting human beings. Far better than you (the able-bodied, or ‘safe’ person) can ‘help’ me by looking down from your awesome heights and feeling bad for me.
*I* don’t feel bad for me. I am tired, yes, and I have a lot to be getting on with that feels more important than endlessly going through the identical conversation with concerned friends. But would I exchange my life for theirs? I don’t think so.
Being bombed sucks, and being disabled sucks and that’s a fact. But so many things suck in this world. I’ll take my problems over anyone else’s, and that is fine with me.
I do get irate, down-right purple-faced, about the b.s. media. I really hate the mis-information and the lies. Absolutely sends me. People who actually believe the stuff that they read and hear in the media annoy me as well, it’s not as if there isn’t ample proof that the stuff they put out is complete and utter nonsense. Not just about the situation here. Seriously.
Yeah, but I don’t wanna write about that anyway. I am just tired, too tired. Can’t multi-task at all. I have two people I have to call back, one who called and then I had to run for the ‘shelter’ of the middle of the house – where I ate my breakfast today. And another who called while I had two kids wanting something from me. There isn’t enough of me to go ’round. So it goes.
I am happy and grateful to be here in my wonderful home, in this wonderful and crazy country. More grateful than you can imagine that my kids are all doing as well as they are, and that I turned out to be as good a mom as I did. The odds weren’t good, I’m telling you. I feel lucky to be alive, and, while I wouldn’t choose it if anyone had given me a choice, I can see so very many ways that me being crippled has made me into a better person, wife, mother.
So that’s it from the crippled/war front today. I’m too tired even to distinguish things. Just annoyed, and impatient, and when I have a few minutes to think about it, very, very happy with how things have turned out for me.
Crazy, no?
Just remember, if someone asks you if you want to be disabled, say ‘no.’
If someone asks if you want to live in a war zone, you may have to give that one a bit more thought. Seriously.",How does the person feel about their friends who are not in the middle of the situation with them?,The person feels annoyed by their friends who are not in the middle of the situation with them.

"What if I told you I had family members named Itchy, Frec, Pig and Swampwater? You would think I was lying. Understandably. I know Hubs thought I was telling a tall tale. But Hubs is a SoCal native and people here don’t have names like that. So before Hubs and I were married, I felt it was important to take him to a family reunion in Mississippi. That way he could meet the above mentioned kinfolk and, more importantly, have a vague idea of what it meant to marry someone whose family is from the South.
In an effort to gently ease my soon-to-be Hubs in true Southern culture, we first stopped in New Orleans. I can already hear the gasps from my Southern kinfolk. Mississippi and New Orleans have little in common outside of a neighboring border. Mississippi is the Bible belt where there is no drinking on Sundays and New Orleans has Mardi Gras and allows you to drink while walking down the street. Southern cuisine and Cajun-Creole cuisine are also quite different. If this soup were Southern it’d have collard greens and chicken, but it’s an ode to cajun-creole cooking instead with the Andouille sausage and cajun spice.
It rains a lot in the south and that hot summer day we were in N’awlins was no different. Buckets of rain dumped from the sky when soon-to-be Hubs and I ducked into a romantic little bar for some drinks and hot soup. So when I went to lunch this week at Urban Solace with some friends and we set outside in their French Quarter-esque patio, I couldn’t help but think of that day. When the rain arrived that evening it was only inevitable I make a creole-style soup.
The seasoning in this soup is similar to my Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup I made in February, it’s got a sinus-draining kick. I swapped out rotisserie chicken for pre-cooked chicken Andouille sausage and spinach for kale. I added the carrots and potatoes from this weeks CSA basket. The mint garnish was sheer accident as I had chopped both cilantro and mint. One was to garnish soup the other to add to a drink. I accidentally put the mint in the soup and it was actually better than the cilantro. The mint garnish really mellowed the spice. It was a great accident.
And what did soon-to-be-Hubs do when he actually met my cousin Swampwater? Well, that is a post for another day…
Spicy Kale and Chicken Andouille Soup
1 lb Chicken Andouille Sausage (pre-ccoked) and sliced thin
1 Bunch Kale, stems removed, greens chopped
1 yellow onion chopped
6 small red potatoes, diced 1/4 inch thick
1 small bunch carrots, peeled and diced
1/4 C. chopped fresh cilantro
2 Quarts Chicken Stock (I prefer stock in a box vs broth in a can)
1/2 Bottle of beer (not wheat based or dark)
1 Tbl. Olive Oil
2 bay leaves
1 Tbl. Emeril’s Essence
2 Tbl. Majestic Garlic Cayenne (optional, see previous post for purchasing info, or substitute 2 minced garlic cloves and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper)
Salt and Pepper to taste
Fresh chopped mint for garnish (about 1/4 cup)
In a dutch oven or large soup pot over medium heat, saute onions in olive oil and salt and pepper for 2 minutes. Add andouille, diced potatoes and carrots and the cayenne garlic. Saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 1 Tbl. Emeril’s Essence seasoning and saute another minute. Add half a bottle of beer to deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits on the bottom. Add the chicken stock, bay leaves, cilantro and chopped kale. Bring to a boil and reduce heat immediately to low and cover.
Simmer on low for 30 minutes or until potatoes are fork-tender. Serve in bowls with chopped mint as garnish.",What are the main ingredients in the Spicy Kale and Chicken Andouille Soup recipe mentioned in the context?,"The main ingredients in the Spicy Kale and Chicken Andouille Soup recipe are Chicken Andouille Sausage, Kale, yellow onion, small red potatoes, carrots, fresh cilantro, Chicken Stock, beer, Olive Oil, bay leaves, Emeril’s Essence, Majestic Garlic Cayenne, Salt and Pepper, and fresh chopped mint for garnish."

This new single taken from their forthcoming album ‘Welcome to Condale‘ sacrifices brilliant lo-fi sounds for polished production and Best Coast style vocals – which is great on paper but a mild disappointment in Summer Camp’s case. Here it is nonetheless.
2. Burning Hearts – Into The Wilderness. Now for something a bit more brilliant! Burning Hearts released their ‘Into The Wilderness’ EP earlier this year and it is stunning. Very dreamlike and like nothing i’ve heard for a little while which is refreshing.
3. Gruff Rhys – Shark Ridden Waters. Arguably the genius of sun soaked music [ok, so there’s Brian Wilson too], Gruff Rhys gives us a catchy but unusually melancholic track.
4. Stefano Liberati – Abissi Violenti. A new internet discovery of general wierdness/amazingness happened the other week. After stumbling across a soundtrack by Stefano Liberati when looking up KPM library music, i ordered the vinyl straight away for it’s funky thriller music. Then i looked up the actual film of the soundtrack and discovered it’s a scuba diving naked girls horror film [the genre is probably something like scubarotica]. I also discovered that someone’s made a list of any film containing scuba diving girls. What the flip?!
5. TV Girl – Baby You Were There. Hawaiian stylings will always fill us with joy here at Moogie [ever since we did our Hawaiian themed night]. TV Girl, one of our new favourite discoveries, fill up this track with Hawaiian loveliness and sunkissed breeziness which makes us want to go on ice-cream dates. Anyone looking to go on ice-cream dates with us should email us with an in-depth description of their favourite cupcake.
6. Hotel Mexico – Dear Les Friends. Another new band for you [actually recommended by TV Girl]. Dear Les Friends evokes hazy July memories and evenings sitting around in shades and grass. We think it’s pretty similar to Ariel Pink with it’s high pitched muffled vocals, melody soaked riffs and occasional discordance.
7. Unknown Mortal Orchestra – Ffunny Ffrends. Following on from having songs with ‘friends’ in the title and muffled vocals, this is another melodic catchy song. Despite having an daft respelling of words, Ffunny Ffrends has captured our imagination this week with it’s simplicity – it keeps looping in our heads when we’re trying to make posters and watch scubarotica. Possibly set to be a Moogie anthem in the same way that Twin Sister’s ‘All Around And Away We Go‘ caused quite a lot of people to give us their mobiles.
8. Dino, Desi & Billy – Thru Spray Coloured Glasses. Nothing need be said, just watch and swoon.
9. Tiny Fireflies – So Sad To Say Goodbye. And in a moment the unexpected sun will go and the impending doom of winter will hit us like a brick to a shin. Tiny Fireflies are a whispier Camera Obscura with the sweetness of The Marshmallow Kisses and the ability to turn that brick into a bag of feathers.
Moogie Wonderland is this Saturday at Oliver’s, Rochester High Street…hear much of this music there!

"TOWNSEND -- In the past month, firearms license applications have soared in the local communities.
""It's been crazy,"" said Townsend Police Chief Erving Marshall. ""We've been inundated with people coming in for licenses to carry and so forth.""
The influx has been so great, in fact, that the computer systems hooked up to the Firearms Records Bureau has crashed several times. The administrative assistant has had to put in additional hours to keep up with the demand.
In the last two weeks, over 50 residents have come into the station to pick up applications for weapons licenses. Last Tuesday, 14 residents, some waiting for two hours, came in to pick up applications.
""Generally we have maybe three or four people coming in. Usually with hunting season, November is our busiest time,"" said Marshall. ""We've been having upwards of 10 to 15 people coming in. We've actually had to start turning people away because there were too many.""
In the first three weeks of January, the department processed 34 applications, 17 of which were new applicants. In the entire month of December, the department processed a total of 18 applications, seven of them new.
Pepperell has also noticed a surge of applications.
""Over the last month or so, it's increased sharply,"" said Police Chief David Scott.
In December, 23 total applications were processed by the Pepperell Police Department, a number consistent with the months leading up to it.
The increase has been so dramatic that the department has posted a notice both in the building and online that due to the high volume, effective immediately, all firearms license applications are by appointment only.
Marshall speculated that the recent trend aligns with the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Conn. and social commentary surrounding second amendment rights.
""Since Sandy Hook, people are really getting paranoid about the federal government cracking down on firearms. I think that's what's driving this whole thing,"" said Marshall.
The departments aren't the only places noticing the spike. Massachusetts firearms safety courses have been seeing the same trend.
Steve Hathaway, director of the Massachusetts Firearms Safety School, said he has seen a doubling of the number of students coming in for the training classes in the last month, spiking from approximately 50 students per day to about 100. Mike Zenga, director of Massachusetts Gun Safety School, said he has likewise noticed the increase. A week after the Newtown incident, he said, he noticed about a 50 percent increase in students.
""It's all related, without question, to recent events,"" said Hathaway.
What's more, said Hathaway, is that because those applying for license renewals are not required to take the course again, nearly all of the students he sees are new applicants.
""People are making the (choice) and paying $100 to take the class, paying $100 to get the license, taking a day class which means taking time off of work. They're putting an inordinate amount of effort into this decision,"" said Hathaway. ""This portion of the populace is basically saying they've made their choice and they're putting resources and significant effort behind that choice.""
Hathaway echoed Marshall's speculation on the driving force behind the surge.
""Based on my interactions with some of our students, I get the idea that what's driving these things isn't so much people saying 'I need to do this because bad events like this can happen anywhere and I need to be prepped.' I think what's happened is politicians are scaring people,"" said Hathaway. ""The politicians scrambling to ban guns come off as so aggressive, it makes people believe if they don't get a license now, they will never be able to own a gun. It's ironic because there's probably no one that's more disgusted, if I could use such powerful word, (by this surge) than anti-gun politicians. It's not their intention. They don't want it, but they are cause of it, not anyone in the gun industry.""
There are three varieties of licenses that residents are able to apply for: Firearms identification cards (FID cards), class A license to carry, and Class B license to carry. Class A is the only license that allows for carrying a concealed weapon. FID cards permit purchasing and carrying only non-large capacity weapons.
New license to carry applicants must by 21 or older. FID applicants must be 18 or older, or 15-17 with parental approval.
Residents are also able to apply to carry chemical sprays such as mace.
Applicants are required to submit three letters of recommendation and to show proof of residency. Anyone that applies for a first time license to carry must undergo a mandatory training course by an approved instructor. As long as the applicant is a legal resident, anyone can apply.
But not all applicants are accepted. The departments fingerprint every applicant and run criminal history reports through the Federal Records Bureau. Certain things in criminal history result in automatic denials. Convictions for operating under the influence or convictions for any violent crimes, including assault and battery, are disqualifiers.
Additionally, the police departments can deny an applicant for suitability.
""Say they don't have a criminal record, but a resident comes in with a past history domestic violence, though they've never been charged ... I can deny him based on suitability to carry firearms,"" said Marshall.
Every applicant is also run through the Department of Mental Health, said Scott.",What are the three types of licenses that residents can apply for according to the context?,"The three types of licenses that residents can apply for are Firearms identification cards (FID cards), class A license to carry, and Class B license to carry."
"What’s Happening in Children’s Ministries (Jan 7, 2018)
Happy New Year to all of you! WCPSS played a little trick on us this morning, but I hope that your children are now settled back into school 😊.
Children’s Ministries is back in full swing and there is A LOT going on. Please read this email in it’s entirety…there is information about Acolyte classes, VBS and Teddy Bear Tea! $1193.57 toward our goal of $3000.00.
- Sunday School and Children’s Chapel resume on Sunday! Sunday School will start at 10:10am in the Education Building and Children’s Chapel, for children ages 3-2nd grade, will be held at the 9am and 11:15am services.
- Pre-EYC meets next Sunday, January 14 at 11:15am. 4th and 5th graders-we are looking forward to seeing you!
Sunday School this Week: Nicodemus Pays a Secret Visit.
Summary: Nicodemus is a religious leader, a Pharisee. He pays a secret visit to Jesus to try to find out who he is, and to learn from him. Jesus talks to Nicodemus about the need to be “born again” or “born from above” (both meanings are acceptable translations from the Greek). Nicodemus misunderstands. He keeps pressing Jesus for understanding, and Jesus, with just a little impatience, keeps explaining how the Spirit will work in us.
Episcopal Thread: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son…” These words are so famous in Christianity that often one can say only “John 3:16” in place of the words themselves and others will know them. Again in the Episcopal Church, a balance. There is no single sentence that has priority over all others in the Bible. This passage is one of the sentences of comfort that are said by the priest after confession and absolution in Holy Eucharist, Rite I (BCP, p. 332). Nicodemus’ experience is like the experiences of many of us in the church. We wonder, we doubt, we have a hard time understanding. We may leave the church—and then come back. Jesus does not condemn Nicodemus for his doubts. Neither does the Episcopal Church condemn for doubting. Because Anglicans honor reason as one of the “three stools” of Anglicanism (along with Scripture and tradition), doubt is seen as natural. Understanding may come gradually, as it did with Nicodemus. For Anglicans, faith and salvation are part of a process of encountering God and living into a relationship with God that is lifelong, cradle to grave.
Things to wonder with your children:
■■ Who came to see Jesus, and when did he come?
■■ What did he want from Jesus?
■■ What did Jesus say to him?
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about Children’s Ministries.
See you on Sunday!

"The Boston Preservation Alliance Recently Awarded the 2013 Preservation Achievement Award to the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Project in Boston, MA. The Boston Preservation Alliance Preservation Achievement Awards are bestowed annually to honor outstanding achievements in historic preservation and compatible new construction in Boston.
The Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, located at Parcel 6, has been one of the more difficult sites to develop in the Charlestown Navy Yard. This northeast end of the Navy Yard, often referred to as ""Yard's End"" had a long life as part of the military complex dating back to 1800 when the navy bought this pastureland for ship repair, storage and as an arsenal. Over the years, and through expansion, the area had multiple uses: timber receiving dock, wharfs and dry docks, and naval hospital for injured sailors. When the Boston Redevelopment Authority acquired the property, hard-to-find century-old live and white oak found on the site were donated to the Mystic Seaport preservation shipyard to repair historic ships. A considerable amount of granite block found on site incorporated into the site landscaping of the new Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
Spaulding undertook a challenging site with this project: hazardous waste cleanup, state open-space requirements due to its harbor adjacency, harborwalk issues, and more. Spaulding's LEED-certified building, developed by Partners Healthcare Real Estate and Facilities, incorporates cutting-edge energy efficiency and sustainability technologies in a design that integrates well with the historic waterfront site. To meet the fifty percent publicly accessible open space requirement, Spaulding developed outdoor space to cater to both patient and public populations with a therapy garden and active sports plaza for patients and dining and environmental plazas that all can enjoy. (Source: BostonPreservation.org)
GZA's involvement included condition assessment and design of repairs and reconstruction of existing waterfront structures. Additionally, GZA designed a fully accessible Harborwalk and floating dock at an adjacent property on the Little Mystic Channel. The floating dock provides water access for Spaulding's water therapy program. Access to the float was provided by a series of pile supported floats and gangways that maintain fully compliant handicap access.","What were some of the challenges faced by the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Project in Boston, MA?","The Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Project faced several challenges including hazardous waste cleanup, state open-space requirements due to its harbor adjacency, harborwalk issues, and more. They also had to meet the fifty percent publicly accessible open space requirement."

I SAVE it, do the CONTINUE but when i return to check what I entered, it is blank.
Does Windows 7 have anything to do with it? i use the Firefox to make the changes. Seems that IE does not like to logon to my router in Windows 7 either. Only Firefox works.
weird.
Of course, Linksys will not help unless you pay them $29.00 which is about how much the router is worth.

The biggest issue with playing Fallout 4 VR on WMR is undoubtedly the controls. While WMR motion controllers are sort of a mix between Oculus Touch and the Vive wands, the touchpads just aren't quite the same.
Because smooth movement — the type that's best suited for immersion — requires constant contact with the touchpad, you'll quickly notice how it's not as responsive on WMR as it is on Vive. It seems like it will occasionally send you off in a direction you didn't want to go, and you'll have to remove your thumb and let if figure itself not. This could have to do with moisture on the hands during long periods of play.
The WMR controllers also don't let you travel as quickly as on the Vive. I kept checking my Pip-Boy to see if I was over encumbered, but really it's just the touchpad not picking up that my thumb is close to the edge. Luckily, there is an option in the VR settings that lets you choose how fast smooth movement actually moves. With it cranked up, the difference becomes negligible, but only if you're used to the medium speed of movement on the Vive.
Sprinting, because it requires you to actually click down the touchpad, works fine all the time, but it drains your Action Point (AP) meter and can't be used continuously. Likewise, if you're particularly prone to nausea or just prefer using teleportation, movement works just fine using the trigger to point and teleport.
Other than the movement speed issue that can be mostly fixed and the occasional direction changes, controls are on an even playing field with the Vive. All buttons from the Vive's setup have an intuitive spot on the WMR motion controllers, and the angle at which you hold the controller to aim down the sight of your gun feels just as natural.
Tracking
Fallout 4 VR can be a physical game involving a lot of quick movements, and the Vive's lighthouses are certainly up to the task of seeing everything. No matter what I was doing, including swinging madly with my bat at gangs of raiders, I didn't feel that my in-game motions were different than my actual motions.
For the most part, tracking on WMR is also precise, but you'll occasionally experience a controller losing its place if it's moved too far out of view of the sensors on the front of the headset. Still, this is rare and goes to show just how well the built-in motion tracking can compete with the Vive's lighthouses.
Graphics and visuals
Now that Bethesda has released a couple of beta patches for Fallout 4 VR's graphical problems, the game looks quite good on both Vive and WMR. Your PC is using the same hardware, and the game is going through SteamVR no matter which headset you're using.
However, the display in the HP WMR headset does have a higher resolution (1440 x 1440 compared to 1080 x 1200) than the Vive, and after playing Fallout 4 VR for a few hours on both, it's safe to say that WMR is bringing a clearer picture.
It's easier to pick up targets from a distance — something that's required since the scopes aren't currently showing anything more than a solid black color — and overall it's simply more pleasant to look at. When using WMR, the in-game controllers do show up as WMR controllers, so there are no weird cognitive issues. Some of the overlay does sometimes get clipped by the large ring, but nothing game-breaking.
Setup
If you look at both setups as coming from a state of no VR at all, WMR is much easier to get going. You plug in the headset, run through a couple of training exercises, trace a border, and you're in, ready to launch SteamVR and Fallout 4 VR.
The Vive isn't necessarily a chore, but you do have to set up your two tracking lighthouses. These don't have to be permanently fixed, but they do need to be placed relatively high and do come with the hardware for wall mounting. The software setup doesn't take much time, but you might have to sit around and wait while controllers and lighthouses receive firmware updates with a wired connection.
Neither setup is particularly painful, but if you're rushing home with either setup and need to get into Fallout 4 VR, like, yesterday, WMR should get you there sooner.
Price
Fallout 4 VR requires a respectable gaming rig for it to run properly. Recommended specs from the Steam Store page are:
- CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X
- RAM: 16GB
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 or AMD RX Vega 64
Plenty of people are finding that some of the top 9-series NVIDIA GPUs are running it without a problem, but as a bottom line, you're going to need something that costs a decent amount of money whether you're using the Vive or WMR.
Setting performance hardware prices aside, you're looking at about $600 for the Vive system, including wands, lighthouses, and a free copy of Fallout 4 VR.
WMR bundles, which include the headset and controllers, start at about $400 and go up to about $500. One thing to note is that WMR bundles do seem to see some pretty significant price drops during sales; the lowest we've seen is about $200 knocked off the total price.
Which is better for Fallout 4 VR?
Fallout 4 VR (about $60) was made to be used with the HTC Vive, and it shows. The Vive wands deliver precise controls, and the tracking is spot on for a game that often requires wild movements.
WMR, however, shouldn't be counted out, and I can see myself often slipping into the Windows headset for a quick romp when I don't feel like plugging in the Vive's lighthouses. The control issues I saw definitely aren't game-breaking, and superior visual clarity is certainly a huge perk.

1st semesters are few coming into the Spring semester, but they exist. Beyond being kind and giving directions on how to get to certain classrooms, there is wisdom that upperclassmen can offer to the newbies, without being condescending and which would help them navigate Berklee (and sometimes life) in a much better way. Here’s my top 10:
7. You’re special, but you’re not special.
Yes, you can sing (or play) your face off, but you know that you’ve now just immersed yourself into a place where the majority of students can also do that as well, right? Confidence is key in this business, but don’t get so cocky that everyone hates you within your first two weeks. Relax. Your runs will make room for you.
6. Don’t be that person who fails ACI.
We know. We all think it’s not a very useful class, but it’s required of you, and do you really want to be the person retaking it next semester? Buckle down because at the end of the day, it’s one of the few easy (well, easier) A’s you’re going to get during your Berklee career.
5. The RAs are cool, but they will still write you up for breaking the rules.
Oh, you thought you were going to hotbox or play beer pong in your room with your RA because that’s your homie now? It’s their job to help you acclimate to life on campus. It’s also their job to ensure there is no underage drinking, no drug use, and that residents are being responsible. Don’t get so comfortable that you forget that.
4. The Freshman 15 is real, boo.
You may be juiced that the Caf has burgers, fries, nuggets, and an assortment of other kinds of junk food available to you every day, but trying eating that exclusively all semester and see if you don’t look like a cute and chubby version of yourself by the end of the semester. There’s nothing wrong with body changes, but we should be a little health conscious as well. Mix in that salad bar they have downstairs sometimes, too.
3. If you’re flailing in the class, go to office hours.
To a professor, nothing’s worse than someone who has sporadically done the homework, had lukewarm participation in class, done poorly on every test, and then shows up the week before finals asking what they can do to turn their D into a B. That teacher is giving you major side-eye and has no compassion for your situation. You will know when you’re flailing at the latest by midterms. If you hit every office hour consistently after that, you teacher is much more likely to work with you to get that grade up, because they see you putting in the extra effort.
2. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t get picked for the first thing you audition for.
Oh, you weren’t chosen for Singer’s Night and you didn’t get a Caf Show? It’s your first semester. Relax. First of all, you’re competing with people who are in their last semester and are almost guaranteed to get what they go out for. Secondly, rejection is a part of life and a huge part of the business we find ourselves aspiring to join. Get the feedback from the audition, and keep it moving.
1. MUSIC IS THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.
We know, we know. You met the person you’re going to spend the rest of your life with in the practice rooms. You guys were both playing that new Bruno Mars single, your eyes met across the hallway, and you knew. You’re young, this is college, you have like 8 classes. We’re not saying don’t date, but don’t get so wrapped up in your love affair that everything you came here to do takes a backseat. Networking means meeting more than one person, so keep it light. Music should be your main focus right now. Actually practice, actually write music, actually dig deeply into whatever major(s) you choose, actually do internships whether your major requires it or not. This four (or five) years will fly by in a flash.

"ISA-West, a regional division of the International Studies Association, held its annual conference in September 2017 in Pasadena, California. ISA-West brings together students, faculty, and scholars from around the region, the U.S., and the world to present their research and discuss global issues. This year, with generous assistance from the Rue W. Ziegler Scholarship Fund, two MAIS students presented their Capstone work. Jessica Tran presented her paper entitled “Increasing US militarization of the Asa-Pacific region and its impacts on regional stability from a critical security perspective”. Tristan Burger presented her research project “Small Arms: An Applied Approach to Children in Armed Conflict Prevention Initiatives”. Below, Jessica shares her experience:
After conducting preliminary research on my thesis project throughout the summer, I had the opportunity to share my work at the ISA West Annual Conference in Pasadena, California. Presenting in a panel on U.S. Foreign Policy and International Conflict, I was excited to share my thesis project and gain valuable feedback from peers and established scholars.
Not only did I receive constructive responses for my project, but I also had the opportunity to connect with many scholars whose area of expertise relate to my academic interests. I met my rockstar, J. Ann Tickner, whose tremendous work in Feminist IR and critical security studies inspired me to think more critically about the analytical approach to my project. I engaged in a lively discussion with IR Professor Sanjoy Banerjee on China’s security infrastructure; he promised we could stay in touch and provide guidance on the case study portion of my project.
Additionally, David Lake—the discussant for my panel—offered considerable support to myself and other panelists, including extending the discussion of our papers and general career advice over coffee. These interactions were truly the highlight of the trip. I enjoyed sharing and discussing IS ideas, but the immense support of the IS community in developing emerging scholars was what really blew me away. I left tremendously encouraged with not only my thesis project but also the prospects for life after MAIS.
In participating in the conference, I faced a lot of personal fears—fear of public speaking, fear of presenting my ideas to the world, and fear of rejection. I can’t say I’ve been completely cured of these insecurities, but I’m grateful for the experience to tackle it head on and come out the other side a bit more confident and determined.",What were the titles of the research papers presented by the two MAIS students at the ISA-West annual conference in 2017?,The titles of the research papers presented by the two MAIS students were “Increasing US militarization of the Asia-Pacific region and its impacts on regional stability from a critical security perspective” by Jessica Tran and “Small Arms: An Applied Approach to Children in Armed Conflict Prevention Initiatives” by Tristan Burger.
"Hello everyone! I missed Amy's Five on Friday last week and so this Friday I'm sharing some photos of plants and flowers that I've seen in the last ten days whilst out-and-about.
1. Barker's Pool Piazza Garden, Sheffield City Centre - this little garden is a good place for shoppers and office workers to sit and take a break.
2. At the local garden centre there are displays of cacti and many pots of chrysanthemums. We went there to buy some seeds as well as more bulbs to plant for the Springtime.
3. At home there's an arrangement of a gift of flowers from a daughter.
4. Local people are thankful for the volunteers in the walled garden next to the library in the park, open to the public for most of the day, who are always busy tidying up the flower beds, working in the glasshouses and the plot of land where fruit and vegetables are grown.
5. In our daughter's garden the Virginia creeper on the fence really is that bright red and orange colour now. The roses, the lavender bushes, the heathers and some fuchsias in a pot are still flowering and the Michaelmas daisies give a seasonal touch.
The link to Five on Friday where you can join in and also
connect with the other participants' blogs
As always I wish you a good day and a peaceful weekend.
I love your post. Beautiful gardens and flowers! I am enjoying the photos of your daughter's garden. Beautiful!
There's still a lot of colour around at the moment. The cactus which is in flower is stunning, so pretty.
I really like that Garden outside the office building. It would be nice when you had a break to go out there and also I imagine the view from that office building is gorgeous. All those beautiful colorful flowers your purse is an explosion of color today which is makes a happy post
Lovely pictures. I miss all the little garden spaces that seem to be around every corner in England. It's always great to see people enjoying the sunshine in these spaces. Not so much here in the US town I now live in. People don't seem to spend a lot of time in the park enjoying the flowers and the sun even in the mid of summer. Thanks for sharing your five!
Such a beautiful post, the stunning plants/ shrubs/flowers are a real delight to see at this time of year. Hope you are well.
Great photos odd the flowers and shrubs and autumnal colours from around your City. xx
A lovely collection of photos for Five on Friday.
Gorgeous fall flowers! Such wonderful garden shots! Really making me long for fall...Not too much longer! :-)
It's amazing how much colour there is around at the moment. The Michaelmas daisies look gorgeous.
Lovely colorful post! Chrysanthemums in pots and in a vase make the autumn. The parthenocissus looks spectacular! Happy weekend Linda!
Lovely shots and good to see so much colour in the gardens still. I love that close up shot of the dahlia, always good to see a blue sky background too.
There are still some gorgeous flowers around to admire. Loved your daughters virginia creeper with its stunning colour and those lovely michaelmas daisies.
Have a wonderful weekend Linda :)
What wonderful colours. My garden is now lacking much colour
So much colour in those beautiful gardens. I would love to visit the walled garden, it looks magical.
Green spaces in cities are so important, I think. Your daughter's garden is especially beautiful! Thanks for sharing the wonderful photos, Linda. xx
Love the Michaelmas daisies against the vivid red of the Virginia Creeper - they really speak of Autumn to me.
PS. Lovely colourful header too
Gardens, nurseries, bouquets just all make my heart happy. Your garden photos are just happy photos. I am partial right now to chrysanthemums; so seeing them especially sings to me.
Lovely garden with lots of color. Hope you have a peaceful weekend!
Such beautiful flowers, first time I've seen Virginia Creeper in a long time, looks gorgeous.
So many charming gardens! I love Virginia Creeper, such beautiful green leaves in the summer followed by the vivid reds of autumn, gorgeous! Glad you are feeling energetic enough to be out and about enjoying this lovely fall season.
beautiful photos! Enjoyed looking at them.
Public green spaces in cities are wonderful places - nature can be so restorative to the human spirit. The Virginia creeper is such a gorgeous bright red - it really livens up the landscape. Happy weekend.
Such gorgeous gardens. Especially the public space. While here, we have a government authority that is tearing down plants and trees and gardens. :(
That's nice to have little parks in the middle of a town ! Your flower pictures are beautiful ! Soon there will be no flowers anymore, sigh !
So beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
j'aime les squares et les parcs des villes
ils sont plein de surprises et de découvertes agréables
ces couleurs magnifiques vestiges d'un été
bonne semaine
je suis très contente de votre reprise de confiance
tendresse
I repeat - Brits are born with the flower gene. Everything is beautiful and your skill with your camera is amazing.
These little town/city gardens are worth their weight in gold always cheering up the day. That combination of purple and red is brilliant. I see you've been having some treatment, glad you can now have a rest from it all.
Linda, beautiful gardens and flowers. I enjoyed the cactus! Give yourself a hug and rest!
There is still so much beauty to be seen on these autumn days. That Virginia creeper with asters and rose is a gorgeous photo.
Dear Linda,
How lovely to see the beautiful parks and gardens with pretty flowers and I enjoyed seeing your five on Friday. Autumn is such a great time of the year with all the colour about.
Hope you are enjoying your weekend
hugs
Carolyn
Hi Linda the flowers and the gardens are breathtaking! Huso

What lovely, uplifting pics, we need to see images like this now the dark evenings are drawing in. I just loved those pretty blue asters. Little stars.xxx",What activities are the volunteers in the walled garden next to the library in the park engaged in?,"The volunteers in the walled garden next to the library in the park are always busy tidying up the flower beds, working in the glasshouses and the plot of land where fruit and vegetables are grown."
"Oh Jundai Kayahara, you sure are worried on not connecting to the internet and losing viewers, where Kurobe is in big crisis right now!
Also, Efidolg created a barrier surrounding the laboratory, which means that there’s no internet for Kayahara. You sure are an idiot, Jundai-kun!
Meanwhile, looks like Liu Shen Mi is safe but she’s joined by Tom Borden and Sophie Noël on mourning Toshiyuki “Sebastian” Mozuki’s death.
Yes, Sebastian was a brave man that he protected Sophie’s life. I’ll miss him so much!
Now then, let’s move onto the next scene where Koharu-chan tells Kennosuke, Muetta, and Yukina that the Shirahane residence has a special guest. I wonder who this guest is?
Oh wait, I have a feeling that this special guest would make Kennosuke made since he kidnapped Yukihime in the first place.
Then again, this masked demon assisted him and Yukina a few times already!
Anyways, Zeringer Mundef Bischlei is here at Yukina’s home as he tells about Takehito Shirahane and what happened to him. By the way, this is Zel’s face and he looks like an actual demon!
But let’s get onto it as Zeringer met Yukina’s father as he’s setting up a trap and prove that demons exists.
Of course, they would laugh at Takehito Shirahane’s claims as preposterous! I feel bad about Yukina’s father…
In any case, Takehito-san was surprised that a demon like Zeringer exists that he examined the masked demon.
But eventually, both Takehito Shirahane and Zeringer Mundef Bischlei became friends!
Oh yeah, and Zeringer talked about his home planet that was assimilated by Efidolg, as well as the impending conquest of Earth a few years from now.
And so, Zeringer told Takehito-san to warn about Efidolg’s invasion of Earth to his family and friends!
Sadly though, Takehito Shirahane didn’t deliver the message as he got caught in an accident and his body was frozen to death. Yeah, it’s confirmed now and that’s how Zeringer got his watch!
Even if Takehito managed to tell everyone about Zeringer’s warning, they won’t believe him at all until it was too late!
Speaking of Efidolg, Lefil and his fellow Frontier Officers of the Gezon-Reco Force are preparing to activate the hinge stones.
Yeah, this spells doom for the whole humanity if they completed the process!
Oh, and those who are near the hinge stones will be frozen solid. Looks like Efidolg are such cold-hearted people!
Meanwhile, Muetta ran off towards the forest as she’s confused on her true identity.
Come to think of it, I’m thinking Muetta came from a planet that was conquered by Efidolg.
By the way, Muetta isn’t alone as she’s accompanied by Yukina’s pet furret. Of course, Kennosuke and Yukina are worried about her!
Speaking of Yukina-chan, she and Kennosuke are currently searching for Muetta! Oh and to make matters worse, it’s snowing within the Kurobe area which poses a problem…
…like falling off a cliff as Yukina made a slip and fell down. It would be a downer if Yukina-chan fainted until her body is frozen!
Luckily though, Yukina’s pet furret managed to find her so that it can be relayed to Muetta.
What can I say, her furret is a life-saver and now Muetta is about to rescue Yukina Shirahane!
On the other hand, here’s Yukina’s dream sequence as she’s starting to regret about hating her own father.
But you know what, it’s already happened and the only thing she can do right now is to stop Efidolg!
In any case, Yukina-chan woke up where she realized that she’s inside a shack…
…completely naked with Muetta! Um girls, rubbing your own bodies to generate heat might be hot to watch, but it would be better if you make a bonfire.
On the other hand, Muetta is getting teary-eyed about her identity woes. While it won’t be addressed right away, I think Muetta will find out who she really is someday!
For now, Yukina-chan is there to comfort her. But then again, it’s already been addressed that both Yukina Shirahane and Muetta are descenedants to Princess Yukihime.
Oh look, it’s Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma as he finally found Muetta and Yukina-chan!
Then again, he won’t see them in the nude ’cause they’ve finished wearing their clothes. Of course, there’s no time to waste as they need to stop Efidolg from summoning its main forces!

The Primate Rescue Center staff understand the grief felt following the killing of a gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo and remain dedicated to safety in their own facility.
Eileen Dunnington, manager of the sanctuary located in Jessamine County, said the primate rescue recently held its annual member event on May 21 — just one week before the western lowland gorilla named Harambe was shot and killed at the Cincinnati Zoo. Unlike the zoo, the member event is the one day a year that adults and children from the public are allowed on sanctuary’s property. “For that event, there’s a lot of preparation work to build or to set up temporary barriers … in order to keep the public safe when they do come down here,” she said.

Dunnington said the event is only open to members — or those who donate to the rescue center and it’s the only time children under 18 are ever allowed on the property. In addition to setting up barriers for the event, volunteers are stationed all around to make sure no one leans over or tries to climb over the barriers. “Especially since we don’t have large groups (often), we are very cautious when any groups are down here, making sure that groups stick together or areas are monitored in a way that keeps everyone safe,” she said.
Because the rescue center is home to dangerous animals, Dunnington said they are limited for liability reasons. The rescue center occasionally hosts small, “strictly educational” tours of university students and they must donate to be able to visit. While the rescue center doesn’t deal with the public often, ensuring the safety of the workers — and the animals — is a daily reality. “Safety is our number one priority,” she said. “Not only for staff and any volunteers, interns and any visitors that might be on our property, but also for our animals. It’s sort of an all-encompassing idea, that you can only keep the people safe if you’re also keeping the animals safe.” Dunnington explained that central to the rescue center’s safety policy is the fact that it is a no-contact facility. “So, there is never an instance where an individual is inside an enclosure with any of our animals — at all, ever,” she said.
The rescue center is armed with protocols, procedures, training and mock drills, and equipment to prepare staff to handle any situation.
However, she explained, each safety situation is unique, as was seen at the Cincinnati Zoo, when a three-year-old child fell into a gorilla enclosure and the gorilla was shot and killed. “There are certainly numerous responses to safety concerns, but then also primates in general are unpredictable,” she said. So, each safety situation — whether it’s an escape or if they have something they’re not supposed to have — each situation is completely different. And you can only really prepare for your basic responses and then the details have to be sort of figured out on the fly.”
Dunnington said if an animal gets out for example, there’s no way to plan for what the animal will do — and the same animal could behave differently on a different day. “You don’t know where they’re going to go, how they’re going to behave — if they’re going to be scared, if they’re going to be curious, if they’re going to be aggressive. It just all sort of depends on that situation on that day at that time,” she said.
Following the incident May 28 and a loud public reaction on social media, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph T. Deters announced that no criminal charges would be filed against the child’s guardians.,” Deters said in a news release June 6. “I am very sorry about the loss of this gorilla but nothing about this situation rises to the level of a criminal charge.”
The zoo has stated that the enclosure has long passed inspections by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, but replaced the barrier the child climbed over with one that is 42 inches high. The zoo reopened the gorilla exhibit this week.
Transylvania University philosophy Professor Jack Furlong specializes in animal ethics. He said the Dangerous Animal Response Team that shot Harambe simply made a judgement call. The question of where the blame lies is more complex, but may go back to the agencies regulating the zoo and the zoo itself, which has a responsibility to keep both the animals and the humans safe.
Because they care for primates and monkeys at the rescue center for the rest of their lives, Dunnington said she and her staff are familiar with the feelings of loss. “We certainly would want to express our condolences to the caretakers and the staff at the Cincinnati Zoo, as well as to Harambe’s troupe, who I’m sure also are grieving for his loss,” she said.
Among the many people commenting on the incident in Cincinnati was legendary primatologist Jane Goodall, who wrote an email to zoo Director Thane Maynard. Goodall asked Maynard about the grieving of the 17-year-old gorilla’s troupe.
Dunnington said, though the rescue center doesn’t work with gorillas, she is familiar with the way chimpanzee social groups react to deaths. While humans can’t interpret what they’re thinking, but the animals will appear more solemn and less energetic. “They certainly respond in a different way than if they come across (another) just sleeping. They definitely know the difference and react differently.”
Harambe’s family group of eight are among the 10 critically endangered western lowland gorillas at the Cincinnati Zoo, according to a zoo news release.
At the rescue center, staff gives their animals time to grieve by putting the deceased animal where the others can see them, not in the same enclosure, and give them time alone with the body. Dunnington said in the wild the animals have been observed paying their respects by sitting with the body of a deceased troupe mate, or even touching or hitting the body. She said they it was something they saw with a recent death of a rescue center resident chimpanzee. “They definitely responded to that,” she said. “And each came over and sat with her and tried to touch her. They’re just as emotional as we are and they also live in family-like groups. Our 11 chimps have been together almost 20 years, so it’s certainly noticed when one of their members is missing or is not around any more.”",What is the primary safety policy of the Primate Rescue Center?,"The primary safety policy of the Primate Rescue Center is that it is a no-contact facility, meaning there is never an instance where an individual is inside an enclosure with any of their animals."
"It seems food is a frequent topic of discussion and thought, no matter where we are in the world. This is especially true when you’re on vacation and have the ample opportunity to try out all kinds of new eateries and foods you likely wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else. Whether you’re entertaining fine company or are treating yourself to a five-star vacation, you won’t want to risk missing out on these fine restaurants nestled in the heart of Las Vegas. Consider taking a lunch break at one of these places during your visit to Vegas!
Raku
While this restaurant is one of the more inconspicuous looking places on our list, its menu packs tons of flavor! Raku is the ideal spot for anyone who enjoys sushi or general Japanese cuisine.

"What a pity to leave my nice little room with my own bathroom and my very own power point to charge everything up ! But it was time to move on.
Looking up river towards the thermal springs there was a cloud of fog.
I met a Korean couple of about my age who had lived in Australia for 5 years some time ago . I was amazed to hear that they had left Seville a week after me and had stopped in Ourense for 3 nights. I thought they must have been speed walkers until they told me that the heat had been too much for them in the south and they’d skipped quite a bit using public transport .
There was a long steep climb out of the valley in which Ourense sits rewarded by a view of the city from the top.
I met a man up there watching over some sheep . He was interested in Australia and we had a chat about travelling .
I passed more interesting old villages
and walked along some remaining pieces of medieval pathway.
About this time in my usual absent minded way I missed a turn off and had to use my GPS to find a wast to get back on track. Just when I arrived back on track, two locals told me I had come the wrong way. Thanks!
This photo is a bit indistinct but usually feet take off as soon as they see or hear you . These two were a long way off and stopped still just long enough for me to take a photo.
I took the route towards Oseira because I’d heard that the Cistercian Monastery at Oseira was an interesting place to stay.
The monastery is huge, there must have been hundreds of monks here once . I went to Vespers and there were 10 monks there, dressed in their white robes with the peaked cap as well as some local people.
The albergue is in a huge room in an unused wing with I’d say 10 metre ceilings, 40 beds tucked in the corner and me all alone.
Luckily the local bar was open and I ate very so so food at high prices. Just me alone again!
And almost forgot to say – I lost count of how many figs I ate today – so sweet and juicy !!

It must have been strange sleeping in that vast room all alone!
Almost there Paul. I will miss your very interesting blog. We who’ve followed your walk are fortunate because you’ve told us such a lot about the areas you passed through. I’d now like to do part if the walk- not the whole walk as you’ve done- more like the Korean couple! Cheating.
But as I’m not a bike rider and walking appeals perhaps I’ll choose a route. Thank you Paul for inspiring me! Walking is a recent thing with me and I can imagine family members falling over one another if they knew what I’m contemplating.
Will you be in Santiago tomorrow?

Hi Vicki I’m just having a very nice lunch after walking 26km this morning ! I’m planning to arrive in Santiago on Thursday. I’d highly recommend the Via Sanabrés or part thereof – it’s the last 2 weeks or so of my walk
I was telling a friend about your walk on the phone today Paul. I excitedly mentioned that perhaps she and I could walk a teeny part of your walk sometime next year in order to encourage her in her recovery from knee surgery. She was rather hesitant – I understandably don’t think I convinced her. But then- I have a new hip and I think I’m walking better than ever in my life! Yes- I think the last section of your long walk- the Via Sanabrés would be fantastic. I guess you have a lot of followers who are excited about seeing your record of your arrival in Santiago. I certainly am. Cathy will be glad to have you safely with her and hearing your stories of your pilgrimage.
Hi Vicki I’m getting about 20 visitors a day which is a lot more than I’ve had with previous blogs . It is reasonably hilly here and I’ve slipped z few times on slippery rocks and fell once but maybe that’s because I was trying to walk too fast.
Nearly there Paul. What an amazing time you’ve had.

"Expert College Basketball Betting Advice: Vulnerable Top Teams
As we head into conference play in college basketball, there are generally a team or a small group of teams in most conferences that are viewed as the clear favorites to win the conference. And the betting public is often pretty good at finding these winners. To keep things interesting, though, our goal here is to look at some of those top conference contenders to see which ones could be vulnerable and don't therefore offer as much value for bettors as some people might think. Here are four such giants that could hit a rough patch and be caught and passed by a conference rival. (Posted odds are odds to win the national title)

Arizona (+1000): The Wildcats came into the season seemingly poised to be at least a No. 2 seed in the tournament and perhaps even better. In four days at Atlantis, though, the team's woes were really exposed. They lost three straight tournament games in the Battle 4 Atlantis - N.C. State, SMU and Purdue. There isn't a lot of embarrassment in any of those losses in isolation, but this team shouldn't be losing them and certainly shouldn't be in a situation where they are letting losses stack up. They beat themselves, and that is a real concern going forward. The Pac-12 is lousy this year, and that is a gift and a curse for this team. On the plus side, they should have a fairly sizable margin for error in conference play. On the other hand, even if they play perfect basketball their conference wins may not be enough to help the climb back into major contention for a high seed. I don't think that that is a major concern, though, because the toughness of this team - or lack of it - is an ongoing concern.
Kentucky (+1400): Kentucky always tends to get a bit more respect than they deserve from the betting public - it's the power of the brand. This year we have the combination of a roster that isn't quite as talented as it has been in recent years and an SEC that is much more competitive than it has been in a long time. It's not that Kentucky can't win the conference. It's just that them doing so has seemed like an inevitability many years, and it is far from that this year. Texas A&M and Florida are both very legitimate teams in the conference. This is a Kentucky team that bettors need to be careful of this year.
Gonzaga (+3300): The Bulldogs have played two Top 7 teams this year - Villanova and Florida. They lost by 16 and six points, respectively, and proved that while this is a good team it is not the best squad we have seen. The West Coast Conference title has just been an assumption for many years for the team, but Saint Mary's has always been a semi-threat, and they could be again this year. They also have two losses, and they aren't as strong as Gonzaga's, but this is a talented team that could be poised to challenge the Bulldogs if Gonzaga isn't at full strength. Beyond the top two teams, the West Coast isn't particularly great this year, so there is a good chance that - as has often happened - the two games between Gonzaga and Saint Mary's will be the deciding factor in the race for the title. Gonzaga is the better team, but the gap is narrower than it has been at times, and I certainly wouldn't bet all of my money on Gonzaga.
Duke (+400): 1.20 points per possession. That's what Boston College scored en route to their 89-84 upset win over Duke recently. There is only one way that a team scores at that kind of clip - they are playing against a team that is bad at playing defense. What has been striking since last year is that teams have no fear about shooting from beyond the arc against this Blue Devils team. They know they will get their chances, and they aren't afraid of throwing the ball up. The good teams that Duke has played this year all have done the same thing - throw up the three a noticeably significant number of times. And it's not like these Blue Devils are dominant inside, either. It can't be seen as too surprising that they struggle to defend. When you commit to high-end young talent like they have in recent years you can't make defense your first priority. If they can't tighten things up to a reasonable extent then they could be vulnerable in a conference that has some good teams. They may be the national favorites right now, but this is not yet a championship defense.

"Apple Pay still struggles to displace cash and cards in the U.S., but its recent integration with Western Union shows the mobile wallet has some untapped potential.
Only 13% of iPhone users have ever used the mobile wallet, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing research by Loup Ventures. With those low numbers, many might wonder why Western Union would go through the trouble of adding Apple Pay to its digital channels (Western Union has supported Apple Pay at its agent locations for some time).
As it turns out, there is some decent overlap of Apple Pay users and Western Union customers. According to Tim Sloane, vice president of payments innovation at Mercator Advisory Group, 29% of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union.
Bloomberg NewsBloomberg News
“While initially I thought that the overlap between [Western Union] customers and Apple Pay customers would be relatively small, our Customer Monitor Survey Series … indicates my assumption is incorrect,” said Sloane.
This finding puts Western Union in line with the roughly one-third of US merchants accepting Apple's mobile payment scheme.
iPhone users typically have higher incomes and higher average ticket prices when they shop, and they shop more often than groups with other handsets, said Sloane. “So that should make Western Union happy,” he said.
For Western Union, the decision was all about pleasing that portion of the market, which tend to be very loyal customers, said Khalid Fellahi, senior vice president and senior manager of Western Union digital.
“If we can eliminate a couple steps in the registration process or the transaction for our customers or allow them to manage more easily their cards in one place without having to change that within our app, this brings customers a lot more convenience and doesn’t change anything in the economics of the transaction for us,” Fellahi said. “And we estimated that this population was big and important enough to provide them with this convenience.”
As with other Apple Pay integrations, Western Union allows the mobile wallet to stand in for the manual entry of payment card information, as well as supporting Touch ID fingerprint authentication.
Even if Apple Pay usage for remittances is still lower than other funding methods, according to Fellahi, Western Union wants to stay “ahead of the pack in testing new payment methods because you never know when things are going to take off and have much bigger adoption.”
Talie Baker, an analyst with Aite Group’s retail banking and payments practice, acknowledges that this is probably Western Union’s main reason for supporting Apple Pay.
“Western Union invests a lot in innovation to keep up with the smaller startup disruptors in the space, and they do some really cool stuff technology wise that help them remain a market leader,” Baker said. “Although Apple Pay has been slow gaining momentum in the U.S., as consumers become more familiar with digital payments there will be greater adoption of the technology.”
And it looks as if Western Union’s audience is becoming more tech-savvy. According to Western Union's internal research, its web and mobile business is the fastest-growing segment. Transactions on WU.com grew 28% from the third to fourth quarter of 2016 and its consumer-to-consumer revenue increased 27% on WU.com over the same period.
While Fellahi wouldn’t share specific numbers on in-app Apple Pay adoption, he said customers are using it and satisfied. The initial patterns show the user demographic skewing towards millennials that already use their mobile device to initiate payments elsewhere, he said.
The company plans to roll out the in-app Apple Pay service in the U.K. soon, and also has a strategy for supporting other mobile wallets including Android Pay and Samsung Pay.",What percentage of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union?,29% of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union.
"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — 17 touchdowns, and he added two more, including the longest reception of his career after taking a screen pass 80 yards. The Rams clinched their first NFC West title since 2003 by beating the Tennessee Titans 27-23 on Sunday.
The running back finished with 118 yards rushing and 158 yards receiving, becoming only the third in NFL history to post such a performance as he joined Ollie Matson (1954) and Herschel Walker (1986). Gurley also became the third in NFL history with at least 2,000 scrimmage yards, 10 TDs rushing and more than five TD catches in a season, joining O.J. Simpson (1975) and Marshall Faulk (2000 and 2001).
“He’s a special player,” Rams first-year coach Sean McVay said. “He is playing his best the last couple of weeks when it is the most important, these last couple of weeks.”
Jared Goff threw for 301 yards and four touchdown passes, the last for the final margin with 11:51 left on a 14-yarder to Cooper Kupp. Goff said he knows who he’d pick for the league’s MVP award if he had a vote.
“I know there’s a bunch of other guys in the league doing great things, but he’s got my vote,” Goff said.
Here are some things to know as the Rams and Titans prepare for their regular-season finales:
TENNESSEE IN CONTROL: The Titans (8-7) have lost three straight, and the loss to Los Angeles allowed Jacksonville to clinch the AFC South. But the Titans host the Jaguars to wrap up the season needing only a win for their second straight winning season and first playoff berth since 2008. Losses by the Chargers and the Bills also would clinch a berth for the Titans even with a loss.
“This is our season, and we’re looking forward to it,” Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota said.
ROUGH DEBUT: Sam Ficken missed his first extra point in the NFL and followed by clanking a 36-yard field goal attempt off the right upright in replacing Greg Zuerlein, the Rams’ Pro Bowl kicker. Ficken bounced back by connecting on his next three extra points, and Ficken also put four of his five kickoffs in the end zone, with two touchbacks.
“To his credit, he found a way to respond and came away being able to make the rest of the opportunities that he did have,” McVay said. “I thought he kicked the ball off pretty well. We’ll continue to evaluate moving forward.”
MURRAY’S KNEE: DeMarco Murray had to be helped to the sideline late in the game, and Mularkey says the running back will have an MRI on his right knee. “He’s a pretty tough guy, watched him walk off, didn’t look good,” Mularkey said. Murray finished with 48 yards on 15 carries and three catches for 11 yards.
The Titans still have Derrick Henry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner, who would be in line for only his second start this season and fourth of his career if Murray can’t play in the finale.
SACKED: The Rams came in ranked second in the NFL with 47 sacks, and the Titans ranked fifth after piling up 26 over the past five games. Each team left adding only one sack apiece to the totals.
MORE WORK LEFT: The Rams’ win ensures Los Angeles will host its first NFL playoff game in a very long time. First, the Rams wrap up the regular season hosting the San Francisco 49ers. McVay gave the Rams off until Wednesday with the Christmas holiday. The Rams are a win away from reversing 4-12 last season to 12-4.
“I guess from the outside looking in you’d be surprised …,” Goff said. “I felt good about our year coming into it and now we’re division champs and it feels really good.”

"Vice Media announced Tuesday that a pair of top executives have been sidelined amid a sexual harassment scandal that has unsettled the Brooklyn-based upstart.
In a memo to staff obtained by CNNMoney, Sarah Broderick — Vice’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer — said that company president Andrew Creighton and chief digital officer Mike Germano have each been put on leave, more than a week after the New York Times published a highly-anticipated article that included allegations against each of them.
Over Christmas weekend, the New York Times published an exhaustive, front page story detailing claims of misconduct and misogyny at Vice, and highlighting four settlements reached regarding allegations of sexual harassment or defamation.
One such settlement, the Times reported, was reached in 2016 with a former Vice employee who said she was fired after rejecting a relationship with Creighton. Vice denied the allegations, asserting in a letter to the accuser’s lawyer reported by the Times that it was the accuser who pursued a relationship with Creighton and that she was sacked for poor performance. The ex-employee was paid $135,000 in the settlement, according to the Times.
The Times also spoke to two women who accused Germano, who founded Vice’s digital advertising agency Carrot, of inappropriate behavior, including one who claimed he said he didn’t want to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her. In a statement to the Times, Germano acknowledged the truth of a claim from another woman, who said he pulled her onto his lap at work event in a bar in 2014.
Germano said he apologized for the incident and “agreed at the time it was inappropriate,” adding that “it was resolved with the help of HR.”
Creighton and Germano are the only two individuals named in the Times story as having been the subject of allegations who are still employed at Vice, but their futures at the company are suddenly unclear.
Broderick said in the memo that the claims against Germano will be investigated by human resources and an external investigator — a process that she said Germano “has encouraged.” Creighton, meanwhile, will remain out of the office until a special committee of Vice’s board reviews the facts and offers a recommendation before a board meeting scheduled for January 11, Broderick said.
Broderick said that Creighton’s situation had been reviewed by an independent law firm at the time the allegation was made “and the claim was found to lack merit, but the Company agreed to settle the matter in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation.”
“As we said last week, there are details in the story that VICE believes were incomplete or misrepresented,” Broderick said in the memo.
Echoing what co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi said in response to the Times’ story, Broderick noted that Vice intends to achieve pay parity by the end of this year. She also said that Vice is “committed to 50/50 male/female at every level across the organization by 2020,” and that mandatory sexual harassment training will be announced later this week.
The Times’ article, written by reporter Emily Steel, had been in the works for months, and it became the subject of rampant speculation and gossip in New York media circles.
Vice staffers waited nervously for it to drop, while the company’s brass worked on pre-emptive damage control. In November, Vice announced the creation of an all-female advisory board on workplace conduct, led by Gloria Steinem. But Steel, who also broke news last year on settlements involving then-Fox News star Bill O’Reilly, wasn’t the only reporter digging into Vice.
Shortly before the announcement of the advisory board, The Daily Beast published its own story on what it called Vice’s “toxic sexual-harassment culture.” The piece led to the suspension, and eventual firing, of Vice’s lead filmmaker Jason Mojica.
(Mojica has denied and disputed the claims made against him in both the Times and Daily Beast stories.)
But despite all the buildup to the Times piece, it drew a relatively muted reaction from the media world, much of which had gone dark due to the holidays. Smith and Alvi issued a statement after it was published, saying they “failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.”
But many former Vice employees, including some who participated in the Times story, felt that response was insufficient. In public on social media and in private, they bristled at the fact that executives like Creighton and Germano had escaped unscathed.
Helen Donahue, a former Vice employee whose sexual harassment allegations were included in the Times story, took aim at Smith, the company’s CEO.
“I’m gonna say it: Vice won’t be a safe place for women until Shane Smith steps down,” Donahue said on Twitter not long after the story was published. “Dismantle it from the top.”",Who were the two top executives at Vice Media that were put on leave amid a sexual harassment scandal?,The two top executives at Vice Media that were put on leave amid a sexual harassment scandal were company president Andrew Creighton and chief digital officer Mike Germano.

"No doubt you know who Donald Trump is! Just tune in to ‘The Apprentice’ if you don’t.
So is his Trump Network the answer to wealth & prosperity?
It’s interesting that the great high flying business man would stake his reputation so firmly on a Network Marketing company, even to the point of naming if after himself! Still he named all of his other empires after him, so why not this as well. Obviously he believes in Network Marketing and quite rightly so. More millionaires are created in this industry than any other.
Although there has been massive hype about this opportunity over the last year or so, it’s basically just another health supplement mlm company. I’ve got nothing against them, but we need to face up to the fact it’s a very….shall we say..densely populated industry, with some very stiff competition.
What Makes The Trump Network Different?
One thing that differentiates The Trump Network from others is the PrivaTest, this is a revolutionary system that takes a snapshot of three important metabolic markers to determine the status of your nutritional health in these areas. After its analyzed you will be presented with a vitamin & mineral programme that is specifically tailored to your body and lifestyle.
Pretty cool! Sometimes it’s a bit of a hit and miss affair determining exactly what our bodies need to perform at their optimum, so adding some science to it is very welcome in my eyes.
The trouble with a lot of these health & vitamin companies is that you can get the same (or better) pills or juice at the local health store for less money. At least with The Trump Network you are getting laser focused nutrients which adds great strength to the opportunities appeal and marketability.
In comparison to ‘The Donald’s‘ other business ventures this network seems rather small fry and insignificant, it certainly had many people scratching their heads and wondering what the heck Donald was up to. But you can’t avoid the fact the there are people having some good success with this company.
Network marketing IS a professional business and can make BIG money, but only for an elite few (sorry maybe you didn’t want to hear that, but it’s the truth)
How To Make Money With The Trump Network help ‘convince’ them to join up.
There will be countless hopefuls jumping on board hoping to rise to the top of the compensation plan and claim their fame & prosperity, only to be sorely disappointed when they still haven’t made any money after 3 months. It’s the way it works in this industry. Don’t be fooled by the ‘big players’ who seem to be able to recruit droves of people overnight into the next new deal. The fact is that they have been in the game for a while and probably have a database of 20,000 or more prospects that already trust and respect them.
Just jumping on a new deal won’t make you any richer than the last new deal you jumped on. It takes some SERIOUS dedication and work to make it in this industry.
Here are 5 things you MUST be doing in your Network Marketing business if you are going to succeed:
1) Spend most of your time building relationships & sponsoring
2) Generate your own leads (30+ a day)
3) Use an automated sales funnel THAT PROMOTES YOU NOT YOUR COMPANY
4) Present your opportunity to people on the BACKEND & preferably on auto-pilot
5) Earn residual and promotional income from people who DO NOT join your business
Just keep doing those things on a daily basis and you can’t go far wrong.
Whether you are in, or going to be in The Trump Network, just make sure you’re armed with the tools and knowledge that you need to make this work.

"Katarina General Guide by Persion Katarina, the Sinister Blade. Katarina is an AP Carry who outstands in teamfights. Katarina can clear out minion waves on a short time period. Katarina is a strong and versatile ganker who can easily get to her target and get away from her target.
Although you can easily jump into teamfights and get loads of kills, Katarina isn't a tank. She can't 1v5 the whole enemy team on a normal score. Katarina can only be very effective when she gets kills early game. Katarina is a melee champ, which makes it a bit harder for her to get easy minion kills early game.
This is my first guide I've ever made.
Pros / Cons
Pros:
+ Fast minion wave clearer
+ Very strong late game
+ No mana
+ Great teamfighter
+ Highly rewarding
Cons:
- Needs kills to be effective
- Isn't a tank, can't jump in 1v5 like she's Malphite
- Melee mage
- Gets focused a lot
Runes
In my opinion, pretty standard AP Carry runes. The AP gives some nice damage, while Magic Resist helps you in mid almost always to survive easily and the Magic Penetration makes sure people who build Magic Resist won't take too much less damage from you.
Masteries
Pretty standard AP Carry masteries.
Ability Power, Cooldown Reduction and Magic Penetration in Offense.
Health Regen, Health and Magic Resist in Defense.
Nothing in Utility, since Katarina doesn't need this tree. She doesn't have any mana and isn't a support either.
Items
Probably everyone thought at the beginning of this build while they were looking at the items: Where is the Hextech Revolver?
Well, Katarina doesn't need it. In my opinion, the Deathfire Grasp is a lot better early game on Katarina. She will deal tons of damage when you are doing Death Lotus and you use your active on Deathfire Grasp.
Other items are pretty obvious in my opinion. The Abyssical Scepter and the Zhonya's Hourglass make it easier for you to survive teamfights, since you get focused a lot as Katarina. The Liandry's Torment is great for the end game, since you will deal too much damage for the enemy team to even react to it, and best of all, when you get a kill or assist, you can just Shunpo to the next target and so on!
I don't start with Doran's Ring, because Katarina can get some crazy damage on her early game. This is why she needs to have Health Pots in the beginning.
Skill Sequence
Q: Bouncing Blades
W: Sinister Steel
E: Shunpo
R: Death Lotus
R > Q > W > E
To jump into fights: Q -> E -> W -> R
And then continue this order the whole game.
Farming
Try to get Creep Score by doing this order:
Q -> W
If you really want to farm a little bit more without auto-attacking, use Shunpo, but be sure you won't be ganked or you'll probably be dead.
Tips
You should get some wards in your inventory to:
- Put in your lane to Shunpo away from possible ganks
- Get over obstacles by putting the ward over the wall and Shunpo towards it
Get your teammates to be near to you over a wall when you are running away, since you could just Shunpo over the wall to get away from fights, and maybe bait some people to flash as well and melt their face down.

The cons include the need for early game kills to be effective, inability to tank like Malphite, being a melee mage, and getting focused a lot."
"Marriage season. Festivities. You’re the bride. So many of us have been there, but being so close to the D-day it sure is more than just butterflies. You see that’s the simplest answer the bride can give to everyone asking “How does it feel?”. But its a lot more than that.
It’s a whirlwind. You’re seeing the days pass you by at a lightning pace. Now you always knew the date and were counting it down every time you meet friends. Besties would go a step further and remind you anyways.”So! 1 month left for the big day. All ready?”. “Well not quite, you see there’s so much!”
Truth is you will never be ready. No matter how much of a control freak you are. There is a little bit of knit picking in every thing around you. Some of my friends say they began preparations months before. However being the last minute fix-it persona I’ve been all along, everything can get done is my approach. In fact, there’s a solution for every problem i quip to family. But family, you see its more stress for them. While i sit in the corner and nibble away on small portions, i watch the grand opera unfold. So what is it exactly that I’m feeling?
Absurd. Excited. Attached. Nostalgic. Nervous. It feels weird to look around and think that just one day later, things will change. I’m not afraid of change, its always required and should be welcomed. I know that responsibilities will increase. There is a lot more at stake now you see. Given the traditions we are bound with there are a lot of expectations to be met. Every time i meet someone and they see the cross cultural affair (quite clearly a punjabi marrying a bengali), they gush “love marriage”? In most situations i don’t know what to refer to Arijit as. Sometimes i begin with ‘My fiance’ and other times ‘My boyfriend’. Elders remind, ‘Beta you must always say fiance’. I don’t see how that’s always mentioned because any marriage is the coming together of two people and don’t couples in “arranged marriages” have a courtship period? I’m sure they find love there to actually go to the next stage! Different cultures always mean that the shaadi will come with its set of learning. You see, in the arranged marriage folks have it simpler since everything is understood. But here, we learn so much more with each custom & ceremony. The culture exchange is awesome. It’s going to be chaotic for some, but its more fun to me.
Leaving the family you grow up with is going to be hard. Growing older in one house and lamenting about the color of the walls to moving to a different house with a complete new setup is coming up sooner than you think. You know the annoying neighbors will be replaced by a new set of people. The local shops where they know exactly what you need will be history, the learning curve will start again. Relatives. Enough said, will have their own set of good advice. Which with all due respect, you must keep for your own good. Most importantly, Smile. As the hours go by, I’m rather confused about what’s the big deal really with marriage? To me it seems like the start of a new chapter. The book’s the same, only that there will be more characters and more to explore as we branch out. A larger family to go back to, a richer cross culture learning and a lifetime of bliss cementing a nine year long relationship is what i’m looking forward to.
Minus the butterflies 🙂
wonderful!! very well-written!!

Rupa Didi
Thanks a lot Rupa Didi! Looking forward to meet you 🙂

"Nick Blood’s Lance Hunter is back on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. — and just in time! The former agent, who left the show in Season 3, will return to lend a hand to Leo Fitz in the Season 5 episode “Rewind,” which reveals what Fitz has been up to since the Season 4 finale. Per a clip released earlier this week, Hunter has resurfaced to help rescue Fitz from prison so that they can track down what happened to Director Phil Coulson and the rest of the team.
Speaking to CBR, Blood discussed his triumphant return to the show and what it was like to work so closely with Fitz actor Iain De Caestecker. He also teased Hunter’s reunion with Fitz, as well as the status of Hunter’s relationship with his longtime partner Bobbi “Mockingbird” Morse and more.
RELATED: Agents of SHIELD: A Familiar Face Returns With a Shocking Demand
CBR: What was it like for you to return to the set after all this time?
Blood: Oh, it was really nice! I mean, whenever I’m in LA, I always pop down and see everybody. I’ve got some really good friends on that crew and everything. When they shoot, they’re so busy, because they’re there all day every day, so my options are limited when I come to set to visit. But it was great to see all those guys and they’re such a brilliant team and they all work so well together. They’ve got a level of professionalism amongst them and camaraderie and just the atmosphere on set is really positive, so it was great to see those guys. Then me and Iain were relishing the opportunity to have some fun together. You know, they weren’t on screen together a lot during the time that I was on the show. It was the odd scene here and there, but to get a whole episode together… I think the showrunners know how good of friends we are in real life, so I think they were keen to explore that and see what fun they could have with us.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has always been an ensemble show, but it seems like it’s down to Fitz and Lance for this episode. What was it like to work so closely with Iain De Caestecker?
We’re such close friends in real life. We talk all the time. We’re in contact pretty much every day, really, and speak to each other every week if he’s in LA and I’m here or whatever. So we’re really good mates, and the both of us were just really excited to get the opportunity to spend a couple of weeks together, having fun. Iain is such a brilliant actor as well. I like watching him anyway, and it’s interesting seeing how he approaches a scene and what does he do with it and his kind of take on things, so it was like learning from actors that I work with and so on. We just had a lot of fun and hopefully that comes across on screen. That dynamic comes quite naturally to us.
RELATED: Agents of SHIELD Teases Major Character’s Potential Demise
As we see in the promo for Friday’s episode, Hunter at least tries to help Fitz escape from prison. What can you tease about their reunion?
Hunter has always got that improvisational quality about him. He’s not there with all the whizbangers or the S.H.I.E.L.D. tech all the time. He’s got some dodgy connections. He tries to use those. Sometimes they don’t always come off, so it’s a little bit trial and error, I would say. He uses hit wit and charm as much as he can!
This season has been pretty serious and grim so far. Would you say that continues in your return episode, or do things start to lighten up a little bit?
I think this one is a bit of a lighter episode. It was probably the opportunity for a bit of lightness in amongst the shade, a little bit of comic relief for everybody. There’s moments of seriousness in it and so on, but largely it’s a nice little kind of buddy movie really for this episode and I think fans will really enjoy the dynamic between Hunter and Fitz.
RELATED: Are the Agents of SHIELD in a Parallel Universe?
Hunter and Bobbi have become something of an iconic duo on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Will we learn anything new about Hunter’s better half in the episode?
You get little hints of it! I think what they’ve done really well is provide a few hints so that the audience can use their imagination as to what’s going on. I think it feels like the fans know that relationship and know those characters so well that I’m sure they can piece it all together and work out what they’ve been up to since they left S.H.I.E.L.D., so I’ll leave that to the fans’ imagination.
Do you have a favorite scene or moment you’re excited for fans to see?
My favorite stuff is probably driving around in the RV. Me and Iain were having quite a lot of fun in the front of the RV. I think if you ask the camera crew or the director, they were probably having slightly less fun in the back because I was swinging it around… on the winding roads in California, off in LA somewhere. I’m not the best driver, basically. Let’s put it that way. So putting me in charge of an RV… I think when I first got into it, they had people chasing after it, shouting at me, making me go, “What?! What?!” to try and hear what they were saying. [laughs] I don’t even know now what they were talking about at that point, but everybody was panicking.

Really nice rug! I might give it a try too since it is a really nice idea! :) Keep up the good work! :)
Emily, I was happy to read your blog this morning (and happy to be your Swap-bot partner). I am just about to make a t-shirt rope (trope) rug for my front entry. Thank you for the heads-up on the weight, etc. I think it will hold up very well.
Have a happy day.
This is a really cool rug! And cute cat, too! Nice job!
PamV (Swap-bot Comment on my crafty blog #2)
I love the rug and how it came out using the t-shirt yarn. Your cat is adorable. Don't you just love how they automatically claim things as if they own them? Cats rule.
i forgot my siggy. Kraftykaren from swap-bot ""comment on my crafty blog #2.""
Oh I love your blog! I love to crochet, sew, knit, draw, and make crafts!
Come visit my blog if you'd like! I love exchanging ATC's!
Wow, the rug is beautiful, and your cat too!
My daughter is making one of these right now. I love how they look and I hope she plans on giving the finished rug to me.
I would love to learn how to crochet. Making rugs is such a useful craft that can decorate the whole house.
LOL, I was going to say that is an amazingly good job on the cat. It looks so real. ;)
That rug look really cool. I love the different colors.

"Scheduling weekend at CFT continues, with news of an addition and tweaks to one AAC member’s future slates.
On the addition front, USF confirmed that they will play San Jose State in a rare home-and-home series that’s not off in the distant future. The first game will be played next season, Sept. 8, Spartan, and will conclude with the Spartans making the return trip to Tampa Sept. 12, 2020.
The 2017 game will mark the first-ever meeting between the two football programs. It’ll also mark just the second game for the Bulls in the state of California.
USF had previously announced a home-and-home series with Georgia Tech for the 2021-22 seasons; now, that series has been moved up to 2018 in Tampa and 2019 in Atlanta.
Finally, a 2017 game against Northern Illinois has been pushed back to the 2025 season. The two teams will play the front-end of a home-and-home this coming season.

"Thought of the Week – Open Prep Programming Cycle
Today we’re kicking off a new programming cycle, The Open Prep cycle which will take us through to the end of February. It’s all in the name: the purpose of this block of training is to prepare you for success in the CrossFit Open which starts on the 25th of February. We strongly encourage you all to take part. The CrossFit Open is, without doubt, THE CrossFit event of the year. Last year more than 250,000 people took part from all over the world: young and old, beast and rank beginner. The online competition runs for 5 weeks with one scored workout each week. You guys will do the events at CrossFit City Road where you will be judged. You’ll then submit your scores online to see how you compare with other CrossFitters around the world. Not taking part will result in the instant loss of bro points. And you don’t want that do you?
What does this mean in terms of the new programming cycle? Here’s a rough template for the programming for the next 8 weeks:
Monday – Structured Conditioning (EMOMs or intervals) + Strength Element
Tuesday – Structured Conditioning (EMOMs or intervals) + Strength Element
Wednesday – CF Open WOD (short to medium duration)
Thursday – Low intensity mobility, gymnastics & recovery work
Friday – Snatch or Clean & Jerk + Barbell Cycling work + Squats
Saturday – CF Open WOD (longer duration)
We will be testing previous years’ Open workouts on Wednesdays and Saturdays. These will be the ‘Game Days’. We expect you to really go after these workouts which is why they are programmed without any additional strength or conditioning work. We’ll warm up, look at some specific relevant skills progressions, talk strategy and then get after it!
Mondays and Tuesdays will be more structured. The EMOMs will emphasise gymnastic skills relevant to The Open. That means lots of chest to bar pull ups, toes to bar and handstand push ups. We’ll also use these structures to test your capacity in these movements under metabolic fatigue (i.e. combined with rowing or burpees etc.). The intervals will focus on engine work. Beyond technical efficiency, one of the main capacities you need to do well in The Open is the ability to push hard for extended periods. In order to improve on this we’ll use moderate duration intervals (2-4 mins) with relatively low skilled movements to target your work capacity in that glycolytic energy system.
Thursdays will be low intensity but please don’t think this means they are any less important! This is your opportunity to recover and recuperate. This is your opportunity to improve your mobility and range of motion. And it’s also a chance to ‘play’ with some unconventional movements like rolls and hangs. Honestly, I think everyone should come to this class if they can.
Fridays will continue to emphasise improving your snatch and clean & jerk, but with a twist. After a shorter specific weightlifting element, we will move on to some barbell cycling work. What this means is that we will be practicing higher repetition touch and go snatches and clean & jerks, both power and full squat versions, where the bar does not rest on the ground for the duration of the set. This will be a challenge both in terms of skill and in terms of endurance. Nothing gets you breathing like high rep olympic weightlifting! We finish, of course, with SQUATS.
ENJOY! Oh, and happy new year… How are those resolution coming along?

"So now I’m reading up on Hefazat-e-Islam. The Guardian had a useful piece on April 16.
It starts with tensions, clashes, religious conservatives versus more moderate, progressive voices.
The most recent development is the emergence of a radical conservative Muslim party, Hefazat-e-Islam, as the standard bearer of the religious right. Earlier this month, at a huge rally in Dhaka attended by more than 100,000 according to police, the party issued 13 demands. They included the introduction of measures to stop “alien culture” making inroads in Bangladesh, the reinstatement of the line “absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah” in the nation’s constitution, which is largely secular, and a ban on new statues in public places. not mix in public – seen by many as a bid to stop women working outside the home – that most worried Akhter, one of tens of millions of female labourers in Bangladesh’s booming garment industry.
“If we are not allowed to work, how will we survive?” asked Akhter, who supports her elderly parents on her monthly wage of 6,500 takas (£55). “Many of our coworkers were abandoned by their husbands. Some families only have daughters, whose parents are old. What will a single mother do? We will not have any means for a living.”
Well, you starve. So do your children, and so do your parents. Sorreee.
They explain that it’s all a misunderstanding though.
“The idea that Hefazat-e-Islam is taking the country back to the medieval age through its demands is propaganda,” said Moinuddin Ruhi, joint secretary of the party. “We are not opposing women’s development … Hefazat demands women refrain from free mixing in society to avoid sexual harassment and incidents such as rape. This does not … mean we want them to refrain from going to work or study. They should go to work and study following the principles of Islam.”…",What are some of the demands issued by the Hefazat-e-Islam party at a rally in Dhaka?,"The Hefazat-e-Islam party issued 13 demands at a rally in Dhaka.

"Kogler's 'Cinnamon Shorties' are often the first item to sell out at area Farmer's Markets.
There seems to be little that Steve Kogler wonâ€™t try. Heâ€™s worked on lobster boats in Ireland, owned a garment manufacturing business in Baltimore and worked at the Cape Gazette. Heâ€™s currently launching a career in finance.
His roots, however, are in the hospitality industry, and itâ€™s his love of food and wine that has gained him recognition in coastal Sussex. Since 2002, Kogler and wife Jennifer have owned Teller Wines in Lewes. But lately, heâ€™s been getting a rise out of customers with Old World Breads, which he started in 2007.
His cinnamon buns were the talk of the Historic Lewes Farmersâ€™ Market this year, and people line up for his sourdough at the Bethany Farmersâ€™ Market. â€œHis cinnamon bread is amazing,â€ says Patricia Talorico of Lewes. â€œI froze it and it warmed up beautifully.â€
For Kogler, the bakery is a labor of love. He jokes that he made more in high school, working more than 30 hours in a restaurant, than he does now.
Kogler, who grew up in Baltimore, was 14 when he lied about his age to get a busboy job in a harbor restaurant. By the time he was in high school, he worked after school and did double shifts on weekends. â€œIt was fun,â€ he says, â€œand I made a lot of money.â€
After living in Ireland for a year, the avid windsurfer headed to the beach, where his two brothers were part of the staff opening the Blue Moon in Rehoboth Beach. It was here that he met wife-to-be Jennifer, who was a waitress. Kogler estimates that over the years, heâ€™s worked at about 20 restaurants, including The Back Porch.
He took a detour from the hospitality business to start a garment manufacturing company, but working 80 hours a week became a grind. Although Jennifer had a good job working in city museums, Kogler sold his business and the couple moved to the beach full time. Kogler went from pasting up the Cape Gazetteâ€”this was pre-PCs, when copy was printed out and literally pasted on pagesâ€”to managing a Bose store, which led to a position as a trainer for the company.
Then came 9/11 and an economic dip. His job disappeared in the restructuring that rattled corporate America. The Koglers sold their beach house and opened Teller Wines. The name comes from their desire to â€œtellâ€ people about wine and create wine advocates.
Meanwhile, Kogler decided to try baking. Why not? His mother and grandmother were both big bakers and cooks. Totally self-taught, heâ€™s relied on tips learned from chefs throughout the years and books by baking gurus Raymond Calvel and Jeffrey Hamelman. He also got advice from Teller Wine customer Jason Stickler, owner of DiBonaventureâ€™s Provincial Bakery, who allowed Kogler to experiment in the bakeryâ€™s ovens.
Kogler has learned more than a few tricks. First, find recipes that rely on weight measurements rather than cups and teaspoons. â€œTwelve people could measure a cup and it would be different every time,â€ he notes. Next, use non-bleached King Arthur Flour, his favorite.
Then, keep track of the humidity. A span of dry weather means heâ€™ll add more water. He adapts again if itâ€™s been raining.
Donâ€™t think the environment makes a difference? Think again. Kogler was frustrated when his San Francisco-style sourdough was hardly like the bread found in San Francisco. Credit the wild microorganisms in the air there. San Fran bakers use flour and water as bait to capture yeasts and bacteria, including Lactobacillus sanfrancisco, to create a starter.
Here in Delaware, where the bacteria is different, Kogler has adapted by using a New England starter and adds 24 hours to the usual fermentation period. The sourdough is now his top seller. â€œItâ€™s crunchy on the outside with a beautiful texture,â€ he says. Whole grain bread and baguettes are also favorites.
In the resort season, he makes about 700 loaves of bread for the Lewes market and 1,000 to 1,500 for Bethany. That is in addition to wholesale products. A specially built commercial bakery on his Ellendale farm hums with activity 18 hours a day. â€œWeâ€™re never off in summer,â€ he says. He cuts back to about 10 hours off-season.
Kogler, who has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, is planning for a time when he may not be able to bake by developing financial skills. Fans of his bread, however, hope that time is far in the future.

"The dry oil, also Wild Fig and Grape, smells just as beautiful. I like body oils and have tried a few from different brands over the years but one thing I have noticed is that I prefer dry oils. I prefer an oil which you can spritz on yourself, as I find they are less messy and also last longer. The Palomo dry oil is a unique blend of luxurious oils and vitamin E which instantly absorb in to the skin. It can also be used as an intensive leave in conditioner, but I haven't braved that just yet! Like the perfume, the scent is strong but not overpowering. The scent of grape is the one which pulls through the most for me and the scent is also deeper, I think. I love how this makes my skin look and feel. I always feel like I am really pampering my skin when I use this and as if I am a proper grown up with proper grown up special product. It comes in a 50ml bottle with costs £15 and because a little goes a long way, and its in spray form, I think it's going to last a while. I will very happily repurchase this when it runs out.
These two beautifully scented products have made me feel content. They've reminded me of home and brought back happy memories (and utter longing to go back for a holiday) and I just cannot express how much I love them. I also adore the packaging. A simple and classic design which to me, is really attractive. I've also kept the little paper leaves on the bottles because I think they are so cute and such a nice touch. I see both of these being products I use and use over the Autumn and Winter months because the scents are just so perfect to bring a little bit of happiness to a cold and cosy day. I have also been looking at the gift sets from this range and have my eye on a couple as Christmas gifts for my mother dearest and sister-in-law. I know they will love them just as much as me!
can be interesting.. :)
I've seen Di Palomo in Fenwick and their Fig & Grape hand cream smells amazing and feels amazing, will probably pick it up when I'm next in xx
I've never heard of Di Palomo before but really enjoyed reading your post and want to give it a try! The packaging is so cute and the smell 'sounds' great as well :) x

"Why Your Home May Not Be Selling, Even in a Seller's Market!Price and condition make a big difference, but other factors can also slow your home sale. Houses are selling quickly, so you think

Winter offers some unique opportunities for sellers, so ignore your instincts to let your home hibernate.
It’s one of real estate’s most enduring mantras: If you want to list your house, you should sit out the winter season and let it hit the market in the spring instead. But like so many things in life, finding the best time to sell a house or list that Boston, MA real estate is more complicated.
“The general school of thought — and it most often proves to be correct — is that listing your home in the spring market will reap the biggest benefit,” says salesperson Brad Malow of Douglas Elliman in New York, NY. “But late winter may actually be a prime time for coming to market as well.”. And if your house is the only game in town, you’re likely to have a lot more interest than in spring when the market is saturated.
“If there’s a shortage of desirable inventory, which often means a plethora of buyers waiting on the sidelines, a seller may experience multiple-offer situations whenever they choose to list,” says Malow. With fewer options, traditionally nit-picky home shoppers are more likely to forgo their “must-have” list and give your place a more open-minded look.
2. First-quarter job relocations
Companies tend to place and/or relocate their workers during the first quarter of the new year. This means that every winter, there is an assured populace that’s looking for a new home, quickly. And good news for your asking price: This group often has some credited moving expenses to burn through. If you live close to a large corporation, ask your real estate agent how to target the new employees coming to town.
3. A locked-in real estate agent
Your real estate agent is relatively idle during the frosty months, a drag from their perspective but a boon from yours. And fewer clients means greater motivation to move the properties they represent. They also have more time and energy to focus on your cause, whether it’s finessing your online listing or talking you off the ledge when the selling process becomes challenging or stressful.front property and backyard are up to snuff at every possible moment.
In wintertime, though, the living is easy. If there’s snow, you shovel — that’s pretty much it. No after-work and weekend hours toiling to maintain your outdoor space, and no stresses about its supposed inadequacies.
5. A lighter footprint, literally.
It also means fewer open houses, which can take hours of preparation and don’t always pay off. If you do have a winter open house, you’ll also probably have more motivated visitors — there are very few window-shoppers during the cold-weather months, so you’re not going to see your neighbor’s son’s friend meandering over to report back on your recent kitchen reno.
6. A faster home sale
It’s counterintuitive but true: Homes actually sell more quickly in the winter months, even in cold-weather cities like Chicago, IL. There’s no general consensus on exactly why this is true, although low inventory is quite likely a big part of it. Also? In winter, most people just don’t want to slog through showing after showing. Instead, they want the buying process to be over and done with, and so they’re more willing to pull the trigger.
7. A higher listing price
Another surprise: Statistics show that homes actually sell at a slightly higher price in winter. This owes to several less mysterious factors. For starters, your real estate agent is going to be more adamant about pricing the property just right out of fear the home will languish on the market until spring. (If a property price reflects both the current market and the surrounding neighborhood, that home is more likely to go under agreement at a favorable price.) Motivated buyers might also submit a price that’s too good to refuse. Finally, a fear of rising mortgage rates — rates tend to go up in the spring — might cause a buyer to be more willing to pay a higher price upfront. Whatever the reason, it’s a happy discovery for many people who finalize a home sale when the weather outside is fright",What are some advantages of selling a home in the winter season?,"Some advantages of selling a home in the winter season include the possibility of experiencing multiple-offer situations due to a shortage of desirable inventory, attracting first-quarter job relocators who often have credited moving expenses, having a more dedicated real estate agent due to fewer clients, less maintenance of outdoor spaces, fewer but more motivated open house visitors, faster home sales even in cold-weather cities, and potentially higher listing prices."

"10 Sneaky Ways to Lose Those Pesky Holiday Pounds
Yes, sleeping is one of them.
(SPOT.ph) After all the parties you've attended, beers downed, and food consumed, you can't help but feel fat after the holiday season. You want to lose the extra weight, but going to the gym is a drag. Is there a more painless way to keep fit? We've come up with fun and stress-free ways to help you lose the holiday weight.
If you find working out to be a monotonous task, maybe you just need to switch it up. You might enjoy the variety of Plana Forma and CrossFit, the relaxation of Yoga, or the downright whimsy of Mermaid Classes.
Take a walk in La Mesa Eco Park
One thing we learned from Wall-E is this: walking around will keep you from getting chubby. For short distances, nix the car or taxi and just go on foot. If you’d like a scenic view, we suggest taking a walk in one of the 10 Manila Parks to Visit.
Going to the club and dancing up a storm can actually help you stay fit. Dancing can burn 150 to 230 calories per half hour depending on your weight. Of course, not everyone knows how to dance, so we recommend checking out videos of these no-brainer dance moves from the Top 10 Dance Crazes in the Philippines.
Rizal Park is on our list of the Top 10 Make-Out Spots in Metro Manila
This is another kind of exercise that no one will grumble about-get intimate with your partner! Kissing burns 68 calories per hour, MOMOL burns 238 calories per half hour, and having sex can burn at least 160 calories per half hour depending on how playful and intense it gets. Who knew working out could be so fun?
Black Pig Tonkatsu Ramen at Tampopo
Hot foods will not only burn your tongue, but also burn calories. Dishes with chili pepper, or that spicy bowl of ramen , will curb your appetite and speed up your metabolism.
Running or walking on the treadmill is a bore, but zipping throught the shopping mall is something you can do for hours. You’re not only exercising your legs with non-stop walking, but also your arms when you carry loads of shopping bags.
Cafe Ilang Ilang at Manila Hotel has a good selection of small desserts. That counts, right?
The solution for losing weight: eat more! There’s a caveat though, eat more frequently but in small portions. For instance, try having six small meals a day rather than three big meals to control your cravings and avoid overeating. Ideally, we wish we could all eat as much as we’d like, but this isn’t a bad compromise. You might want to check out the SPOT.ph Directory of Buffet Prices. Hey, you can eat small portions at a buffet!
If you notice some of your clothes are looking dated, it’s time to clean out your closet. An added bonus is it will get you moving. Lifting armloads of clothes, reaching for the high shelves (let’s call it stretching), and going back and forth sounds like exercise to us. You’ll work up a sweat and have a well-organized closet to show for it.
Is sleeping a better alternative for losing weight than waking up early to exercise? Sad to say, no. But it will do your body a lot of good. Sleep deprivation will lead you to crave more food, so getting eight hours of sleep will actually make you feel less hungry and weak. This is what we’ll tell ourselves when we skip working out to catch some z’s.
If you’re feeling peckish, don’t forget to couple your meal or snack with a glass of water. It will help you feel full faster and it has zero calories.",What are some of the fun and stress-free ways to lose weight after the holiday season?,"Some of the fun and stress-free ways to lose weight after the holiday season include switching up your workout routine, walking around, dancing, getting intimate with your partner, eating hot foods, shopping, eating more frequently but in small portions, cleaning out your closet, getting enough sleep, and drinking water with your meals or snacks."
"Yesterday was the graduation day. Now I’m qualified as a teacher. So first thing I do the next day, today, is going back to school and having a saxophone lesson with my friend. I have played with her old alto sax for this semester every now and then but this time I got tips from a real saxophone player. It was lots of fun and laughing. And this time I brought the instrument home after playing. I will buy it from my friend as a graduation gift for myself. Last year it was a ring, this year a saxophone!

103 ECTS credits and few other gigs
My last year as a students seems to be soon over and my second Bachelor degree completed. This 9 months in Oulu have been really busy. One year ago in Tallinn I was thinking about this year. I actually thought I would have more time for hobbies. But now I realize that I completed over 60 ECTS credits (that is normal for one year studies), I’m not wondering that I felt running from one place to another.
There has been many interesting things like project called Particle Plays, a gig in Russia, Ruskatrööttä wind orchestra event in Rantasalmi, FISOC projects in Oulu and Piteå, applying to the competition Concours Debussy in Paris, gigs in Kempele, Rovaniemi, Sodankylä and Kemi, my first real audition in Oslo, Mozart’s Clarinet Quintet, Sonate by Brahms, lots of teaching kids, one more thesis, slowly begininng working in Oulu city teather, and finally my clarinet exam last week.
Of course I’ve also met lots of new friends and other people and got to know city of Oulu with it’s many cultural activities.
The summer is finally coming. I have no clear plans yet, but for sure I will be playing. Next autumn is also already in my mind while I will try to plan how to combine working in the teather and teaching in Kokkola. But I can say that I’m happy to have job in my own field.
FISOC Project in Piteå, Sweden & Clarinet exam next week
Spring time is the busy time. Finally my thesis is ready and soon I will publish it here too. It means I have also more time to write this blog.
May started fine with a wonderful trip to Piteå, Sweden. We had symphony orchestra project with Festivo International meaning the symphony orchestra brought together students from Oulu, Kristiansand (Norway) and Piteå. We had four days before concert to put together Piano Concerto nr. 2 by Rachmaninov and Organ symphony by Saint-Saëns. I played only in Saint-Saëns so for me those four days were also a break with the teaching the clarinet. I had finally time to practice myself! Lovely.
Of course orchestra playing was great too. I met some people I had got to know already earlier in November 2013 when we had our first project together but I also got to know lots of knew people and spent time with friends from Oulu too. The rooms might have been a bit cold but the atmosphere trhoughout the project was warm and happy. It is really important to give these opportunities for young musicians to work together with people from other countries. We also enjoyed a flute concert/exams by our students from Oulu one night.
When coming back to Finland I also realized that my exam will be already next week. I’m feeling quite excited about it but maybe also little bit nervous. I still have many things to do before next Wednesday and also things that keep me away from the playing.
Anyway, I try to remind myself that it is going to be a really nice concert and I wish my audience to enjoy it. Then it will be easier to forget that it is the final exam. And finally I can wear my beautiful dress!
It is possible to follow the concert live from anywhere in the world via Internet live streaming.",What instrument did the individual decide to buy as a graduation gift for themselves?,The individual decided to buy a saxophone as a graduation gift for themselves.

"Clinton Mayor Lew Starling will see his seventh term expire this year and, expressing his desire to see Sampson’s seat continue to grow and improve, is seeking his eighth.
Elected in 2001, Starling has seen a great deal of progress in Clinton, including a downtown that has flourished on the strength of several revitalization projects and numerous new businesses. Still, there is more to do, the mayor imparted after signing the dotted line to seek re-election to a post he has held for nearly 14 years.
“We have a lot more to be done in the city,” Starling stated Monday. “I think we have made good progress in cleaning up the town and trying to rehabilitate the downtown. We still have some more work to do and we have a lot of work to do now that the Great Recession is over in trying to rehabilitate some of the neighborhoods as well, and we will be working on that.”
The focus will remain on attracting jobs and businesses to Clinton, he said.
“With the economy the way it’s been, it’s been difficult to do things. We’re having more interest now than we’ve had but there’s just a lot of work left to be done,” Starling attested. “I love Clinton and I want to make it a better place to live. I just see more things that need to be done that I would like to work with the Council to get accomplished.”
That Council includes members Steve Stefanovich, Maxine Harris, Marcus Becton, Jean Turlington and Neal Strickland, all of whom have held their respective positions for more than a decade. Along with the mayoral post, the Council seats occupied by Strickland (District 2) and Turlington (District 4) are expiring. The mayor is elected every two years in Clinton, Council members every four.
Strickland and Turlington filed for re-election within moments of each other last Monday, the first day of the 10-day filing period. Both said they were excited about the prospect of returning to the board, commenting on the synergy of the elected group.
“The Council works very well together,” Starling stated. “While we may debate an issue or agree to disagree, the Council works very well together and everybody has the same interest in mind, and that is bettering the town. We rarely have a split vote, we rarely have a dissenting vote because we debate everything and City Council is just not going to do or approve anything that is not in the best interest of the city, period.
“We’re excited about trying to grow and continue to improve the city,” he said.
Just last week, Starling was with Gov. Pat McCrory, who talked about the importance of the state’s cities. The governor said when representatives of a business or industry make a trip to the state to possibly set down roots, those industry leaders often request to go to that particular county’s seat “because that is the hub,” the mayor said.
“That is sort of a reflection on how the county is doing. Are we letting our downtown die or are we keeping it up?” Starling noted. “He was saying that even when somebody doesn’t live inside the city, they come there to transact business and it needs to be a shining star.”
Clinton shines, Starling said, but it is the constant goal to make that gleam brighter.
“We’re so excited about the rebirth that we have,” the mayor said, “and the Council is just biting at the bit to continue to try to implement these programs. We have a lot of things we want to do, but truthfully, growth and budget have been a constraint. We’re hoping that with the new N.C. 24 and some other things we see on the horizon we can implement a lot of these things that will help the citizens.”
A push toward multi-use development in the downtown, notably the inclusion of second-story residential units in downtown Clinton, is one of Starling’s main goals.
“I’d like to see people living downtown, I’d like to see upstairs condos,” the mayor asserted, saying that currently city officials are conducting research and providing necessary support to property owners to bring that to fruition. “We’re encouraged by people who want that. I think that would really change the dynamics of downtown to have people living down there. Just about every building downtown has a huge upstairs and I think to make some of these buildings residences as well — like you see in Raleigh and other towns — would add something to our downtown.”

The Many Uses of Hypnosis
We’ve already determined that hypnosis has many different uses. We will share some of the most popular ways to use this technique today, so you have a much better idea of how it can help you.
Overcoming Phobias – Do you have an unexplainable fear of flying? Do you have a fear of heights? Are you afraid to drive over bridges? Are you afraid of being stuck in traffic? Do you struggle with heights? Is it difficult – or even impossible – to ride on an elevator?
Everything mentioned above is a phobia. If you have an issue in any of these areas, you need help. Hypnosis is a great way to overcome these phobias, and it really works wonders. So many people have achieved excellent results through the help of a qualified hypnotist.
Stop Smoking – Are you a smoker? If so, odds are you’ve tried to quit at some point in your life. Maybe you felt that it was just too difficult. Maybe you thought the withdrawal symptoms were just too hard to handle. Maybe you felt like a fish out of water without your cigarettes.
Like many others, you feel that quitting smoking is impossible. You might feel that it’s just not the right time. Or maybe you feel that it’s easier to smoke than not. With hypnosis, you have a chance to stop smoking without all of the drama that typically goes along with it. You’ll have less withdrawal, feel less uncomfortable and have an easier time quitting with the help of a qualified hypnotist. It’s possible if you open your mind and give this a try.

"What, I must get some of these. In fact, I’ll show you another picture of these ginger candies as a bonus for today’s post.
After it’s been pulled long enough, the ginger is cut into bite-size pieces and hardened. The spiciness of the candy is dependent on the age of the ginger, the older the ginger is, the more spicy the candies will turn out. To be honest, I couldn’t take any of it. The candies were too spicy for me. I felt like my mouth was on fire.

Wah! My mouth is watering…that’s a favorite treat, and I really like it over-the-top spicy. The best I’ve had was in Malaysia, but that looks (and sounds) like a contender!
In Japan, the tradition is to make ginger candy by simply saturating slices of raw ginger with hot sugar-water or honey for several days, and then drying it like a persimmon. The liquid left over from the saturating process is considered medicinal.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she would make a decision when the relationship between the UK and EU was clearer
Nicola Sturgeon has said she will be able to make a judgment on whether to back a second referendum on Scottish independence by the end of this year.
The first minister said her decision would be made when the shape of a deal between Britain and the European Union became clear in the autumn.
Her comments come ahead of the publication of a Scottish government assessment on the impact of Brexit.
The UK government has accused the SNP of trying to undermine the Brexit vote.
The SNP delayed plans for a new vote on independence following the loss of 21 MPs in last year’s general election.
Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Programme, the first minister said that people wanted to see clarity on the future relationship between the UK and Europe.
- Study suggests Brexit pessimism increasing
- Brexit: All you need to know
- SNP calls on Labour to keep UK in single market
- Sturgeon puts referdendum bill on hold
She added: “At that point, what I’ve said is that we will look at that and determine at that stage if Scotland should then have the right to choose between whatever that new relationship with the UK is going to be or choosing to be an independent country.”
When asked if the timetable would be between October and the end of 2018, Ms Sturgeon responded: “That’s when I will be able to look at that and make a judgement about what the next appropriate steps are for Scotland, and I will then report that to the Scottish Parliament and to the people of Scotland.”
‘Democratic referendum’
She was challenged to acknowledge that a decision to hold a second referendum then would not leave enough time for the independence vote before the UK’s planned withdrawal from the EU in March 2019.
Ms Sturgeon said: “We’ll make decisions on timing when we get to that point and look at that.”
Her comments on independence prompted criticism from her political opponents.
Conservative MP John Lamont said: “Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon would rather focus on indyref2 than deal with the crises she has created in both health and education.
“Nicola Sturgeon has no interest in securing a successful Brexit deal, all she cares about is a second independence referendum.”
Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish government prepares to publish their assessment of the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy.
The first minister is adamant that Scotland should remain in the European Union single market and customs union after Brexit.
She said she believed that a majority in the House of Commons wanted to stay in the single market, including those in the Labour Party, who needed to “get their act together”.
The paper will detail the potential impact on Scotland’s GDP, trade and its potential to attract talent from out with the country.
However, the UK government has already ruled out remaining part of the market.
The customs union is the European Union’s tariff-free trading area, which imposes the same taxes on imports from certain countries outside the EU.

The single market also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people..

"Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of opioid overdose, abuse, and misuse. An option to avert OIRD is to treat patients on strong opioids with respiratory stimulants that do not interact with the opioid system and consequently do not compromise opioid analgesic efficacy. The BK-channel blocker GAL021 is a respiratory stimulant acting at K(+) -channels expressed on type 1 carotid body cells. The authors performed a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analysis on the ability of GAL021 to reverse alfentanil-induced respiratory depression in 12 male volunteers using an isohypercapnic experimental design. The analysis showed that (1) GAL021 interacts in a multiplicative fashion with alfentanil and GAL021, which predicts that GAL021 efficacy is reduced at low ventilation levels; (2) GAL021 has a rapid onset/offset with a blood-effect site equilibration half-life not different from zero; and (3) GAL021 displays ceiling in its efficacy to reverse OIRD.

"After stumbling on Donald Trump’s MLM quote after being asked what he would do if he were to start all over again by David Letterman in an interview. He responded
l would find a good network marketing company and get to work.
So, l also got to work to find how Trump’s products sold through network marketing performed on the market.
Donald Trump Network Marketing Company.
Donald Trump in 2009 bought a company called Ideal Health which had been formed 2 years earlier. He employed the company founders as the executives to assist in the transition of the company into a fully fledged network marketing company.
The company was renamed Donald Trump Network and was said to be a way for American to ‘opt out of the recession‘. Lets see if the network marketing model lived up to the hype?
Donald Trump Products.
Just like many other network marketing companies, donaldtrumpnetwork.com sold both the network’s ‘name’ and supplements. There was compensation for referring new people to the network and also for selling supplements.
So, you would make money by selling the brand ‘Donald Trump’ and various supplements which Ideal Health has been producing all along. The difference being that, the products where now being auto-shipped to clients every month.
PrivaTest kit.
New clients would get a urine test kit to collect a sample of their urine. The urine would be send to a laboratory which would come up with a list of deficiencies noted from the analysis of your urine. The testing was for free.
Various supplements in different combinations were then prescribed and would be send to the client or members of the network each month. This was definitely an innovative way to instill fear into clients before milking them of their cash.
Imagine if your would find out that your urine test results shows ‘critical low levels of certain vitamins’. A retest was encouraged after 6 months so that you get yet yet another list of additional vitamins.
As usual, there is NO scientific evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of using a ‘urine test‘ to ‘prescribe‘ supplements. Worse still, there is an obvious conflict of interest when a company tests your urine in order to sell you their products.
Did the Network Bail Americans Out of Recession?
l doubt it. Donald Trump purchased Ideal Health which was already grappling with complaints by both employees and clients.
The network in fact added misery to the American people who had to part with $500 to become members. Desperate network members bought endless lists of up-sells in the name of leadership training and spend hundreds of dollars on advertising.
More money was spend on upgrading membership which was up to five levels. With the usual promise, ‘the higher your status; the high the commissions you will earn’.
Eventually, the company shut its doors and sold the urine testing kit to a company called Bioceutica.
Was Donald Trump Network a Scam?
Yes it was in my opinion. This is what one of the Executive Diamond members, Bonnie Futrell had to say
“They weren’t being able to pay the laboratory for urine tests. They weren’t paying vendors. They weren’t paying us”.
Not paying affiliates and pocketing all the money is one of the worst scams ever. However, paying network members on time does not necessarily mean a program is legit.
For now, Trump you can keep your network marketing, l will stick to affiliate marketing.
Share your opinion or experience with this company? l have shared mine.

"Dearest Reader,
Here is another extract from my diary last summer, when I was going through an ‘almost breakup’ with my now ex-boyfriend. In brief, he had ended things with me in early June but we continued to see each other; a source of much grief which I dedicated a lot of time to writing about. In this entry I also write about making some progress with my eating disorder, psychologically. Reading the words back I feel like I am looking at something somebody else has written. I am so up and down with my remission from anorexia but I am proud of what I wrote about it here and it makes me believe I can get back to that place.
Saturday 28th June 2014
Today, I have no idea what I am feeling and, to some extent, who I am recently.
I’ve spent my first days back at my parents’ hiding out in my room, hoping that no one will talk to me. I honestly don’t know why. In between watching rubbish on Netflix, I stare into space and sigh a lot, asking myself what I’m going to do and wondering why I am so lost and miserable when things were so ok for so long, for the first time since I was an innocent, happy, trouble free child.
Nothing has changed between Gabriel and I in the literal sense, but we are barely talking and I feel that both he and I are beginning to properly let go. I’ve shed so many tears and felt so much intense grief around it all already that I think I am drained of all real emotion. There is even a part of me that wishes it will hurry up and end so I can live my life to the full once again, something I feel he has robbed from me throughout all this pain. When I am here, virtually alone, it’s easier to detach myself from him and not feel as petrified by the idea of losing him as I have been feeling when we’re physically together.
When I am so many miles away I can imagine what life without him at all would be like. I do feel sad and lonely but I don’t think that’s entirely because of him and I know it will eventually pass. He has hurt me so much that I think I will resent him for a very long time. I also don’t trust him anymore, and what kind of relationship can one build upon the foundations of mistrust?
At the moment I seem to be in a state of not caring about my weight so much that it would make me want to starve myself in order to feel confident with another man. I’m beginning to believe that it honestly isn’t the most important thing to men, for us women to be stick thin. I’ve been told that over and over by all my boyfriends as my weight fluctuated constantly. All of them said they prefer me at the upper end of my weight scale. I always assumed all of them were lying to make me feel better and so that I wouldn’t self-harm with food.
It makes me sad for my former self that, with many of the men I have been with, I have gone to such extreme lengths to be skinny for them, hoping they would really want me and find me sexy. With one guy, when I was a lot younger, I can remember not eating from the day he suggested we should meet to the day we did, and often I would binge when I got home that night. I mean, really, what for?! If someone only wants me and finds me attractive because I’m really skinny then there must be something wrong with them, not me! I think I’m beginning- finally- to realise that I am not only my body. In fact, I am least of all my body, and perhaps I shouldn’t even be with people that expect me to be physically perfect. I’m not going to deny that I hate and am disgusted by me weight and shape right now, but I don’t feel like I want to stick my fingers down my throat or take laxatives or exercise excessively or not eat for ten days just because there’s a possibility I’ll sleep with someone other than my sort-of boyfriend. I’m pretty sure that’s progress for me.",What progress does the writer mention about her struggle with an eating disorder?,"The writer mentions that she is beginning to care less about her weight to the point that it doesn't make her want to starve herself to feel confident with another man. She is starting to believe that being extremely thin isn't the most important thing to men. She also mentions that she doesn't feel the urge to resort to harmful behaviors like inducing vomiting, taking laxatives, excessive exercise, or not eating for days just because there's a possibility she'll sleep with someone other than her sort-of boyfriend. She considers this a progress in her struggle with an eating disorder."

My Heart is Steadfast (Ps 108:1-13)
This unique psalm combines the positive endings of Ps 57 and Ps 60 to give us a new psalm divorced from the circumstances that began those two psalms so that we have a psalm of faith for launching into any venture for the Lord. We trust in our great God in spite of our own failure and weakness and trust in Him to help us through to the end.

Do you know you died to sin? (Rm 6:3-4)
The foundation of sanctification is the doctrine of Christ acting as your representative so that we died to sin with him on the cross. Understanding the identification of ourselves with Christ in baptism helps us to understand not only that we died with Christ but also that we are raised with him so that we might experience the newness of resurrection life right now.
The Christian in the World (4)
Having defined the terms ‘godliness’, ‘worldly’, and ‘worldliness’, we now go on a survey that looks at what the Bible says about the Christian’s relationship to the world.
A Bishop kept from the Devil (1 Tim 3:6-7)
We conclude our look at the pastor’s qualifications by discussing the last two on the list. In each of these there is a special danger of being affected by the devil. The church and pastor must be on guard that these traps can be avoided and the ministry in the local church may be pursued according to God’s will.
July 14, 2010
O God do not be Silent (Ps 109:1-31)
This psalm is one of the most bracing of the imprecatory psalms. In fact, it almost offends our Christian conscience. However, if we understand its prophetic significance, we come to realize that it reveals God’s heart towards the traitor Judas who threw away his birthright, so to speak, for thirty pieces of silver. The psalm displays the proper attitude of the Lord’s Anointed against the spirit of Antichrist that motivated Judas and will fill the man of sin in the last days.
July 18, 2010
Baptism is for Believers (Rm 6:3-4)
Baptism is the illustration Paul uses to help us understand the foundation of our sanctification, our identification with Christ in his death. As such, we can learn something of the requirements for proper Christian baptism: immersion in water as an initiatory rite for people who have consciously believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as saviour from sin.
Godliness Revisited (1 Tim 6:3-11)
We look at a passage (1 Tim 6.3-11) that clarifies the meaning of godliness as emphasizing a visible external kind of way of life. Such a life can be counterfeited to a point, but the devoted disciple is committed to a pursuit of godliness, with contentment, from the heart.
Deacons Likewise (1 Tim 3:8-10)
Today we consider the basic qualities required of deacons and challenge our peolpe to be in pursuit of these qualities in their own spiritual lives.
July 21, 2010
The Oracle to My Lord (1) (Ps 110:1-3)
Psalm 110 provides the foundation for much of the doctrine of Christ in the New Testament. It is the most quoted psalm by the NT. As we look at its first three verses, we see the tremendous truths of our Lord as the exalted King, waiting at the right hand of God until the time appointed when all his people will rise as one man behind him and attend his glorious return to the earth.
July 25, 2010
The Power in the Resurrection (Rm 6:4)
We look at one phrase in Rm 6.4 in this message, ‘raised … through the glory of the Father’. We find that just as Christ was raised by the Father’s glory, so to are we raised in our new spiritual lives to the newness of life found in Christ. By God’s glory we are indeed made able to live the Christian life. It is important for us to know this in order to have the victorious Christian life we desire.
Set Your Affections Above (Col 2:20-3:17)
We are getting to the end of our study and are wanting to direct our minds away from worldliness to a true godliness from the heart. In doing so we are looking at Col 2.20-3.17. The passage first of all addresses the idea that trying to achieve godliness by rigorous external religious practices, we will fail to deal with the heart issues. That kind of religion is a kind of worldliness because it is exactly the same as the practices of pagans which has a show of wisdom, but is of no value in overcoming the flesh.
The Women must be Likewise (1 Tim 3:11)
In this message we look at a verse that is somewhat controversial in today’s society and is also somewhat ambiguous and hard to interpret. The question is whether Paul is addressing the wives of deacons or the office of deaconess. Or is something else in view? We attempt an answer and insist that there is no third office of deaconess in the church. We also point to the need for women in spiritual leadership in the church to be spiritually minded people from the qualifications given in this list.

"I suppose I could call this post ""The Mystery Writer's Conundrum""; a kind of obsession with writing something different from what I have written before.
I first started the writing of mysteries after I retired from my day job. That was in July of 1997. I was fifty-seven at the time, a late bloomer. I had always ""wanted to write"", but never seemed quite able to do it. (Fiction writing, that is; I was a hired pen at the Library of Parliament's Research Branch here in Ottawa, and I wrote for a living.) After my first book, Undertow, came out late in 2002, I believed – erroneously, as it turned out – that I was home free, that I had found the magic key. Surely, the next book - and the next, and the next – would flow from my pen (or keyboard), a Niagara of paragraphs and pages. It didn't happen that way. Each of the two succeeding books was as difficult as the first, and took about as long to write.
Now I am struggling equally as hard with my fourth book. About two weeks ago, I sent half the new book – tentative title, Birthright – off to my publisher and his editor. I had doubts about the structure and organization, and I wanted some feedback. To my not very great surprise, the feedback was to the effect that the book as it stands now needs much better organization and structure. Even more to the point, it is not written as a mystery novel, not in its current form.
And that takes me back to the title of this post. In writing the book, I strayed away from writing a mystery. Instead, I was trying to write an historical novel about my protagonist's rum-running career during Prohibition, and – to really complicate things – about the impacts of WW2 on a number of the characters in the narrative. The book, as it stands now, is divided between 1933 - in Cuba and England – and 1947 in St. John's, Newfoundland, the setting for the first three books in the series. Trying to connect the two time periods and the three different locations is proving very difficult.
I believe I am correct in saying that the requirements/ingredients for a mystery novel differ from those of a non-mystery. If one is writing a mystery, the ""mysterious"" part has to be obvious from the start. That is one of the feedback items I received from my editor. I wrote some interesting stuff in the first half of the book – some 168 pages – but ""Where was the mystery?"" she asked me. Well, I replied, the mystery really starts in the second half of the book. ""Well,"" came the response, ""you might want to move the second half to the front, and even dispense with a large part of the narrative as it now exists. You’ve written some interesting stuff, but it isn't clear that it's a mystery that you are writing.""
So, now I am more or less back to the (in)famous ""square one"". On the positive side, there are some 250 pages of text written, some of it relevant to the ""mystery"". And some of it quite good – if I do say so. There are also the characters, most of them well-defined, most of them interesting.
Some years ago, I started to draft a short article on how to write a mystery novel. Had I completed it, the title would have been: ""First, you kill someone."" Someone is dead at the start, and the story goes on from there – backwards, forwards, and sideways. I should have kept that in mind when I started this current book.
For additonal instruction and guidance, I might also have re-read one of my favourite short stories by Somerset Maugham: The Achilles Statue, also called The Creative Impulse. It is the story of Mrs. Albert Forrester, a noted writer of poetry, essays and criticism:
""All the critics agreed that Mrs. Albert Forrester's books were excellent. She was considered by the critics to be a writer of the highest merit.""
The trouble was, Mrs. Forrester's books, however highly regarded, did not sell. Critics do not buy books.
To summarise the story, Mrs. Forrester's husband Albert, who was her sole financial support, grew tired of the pretentious literary life that he shared with his brilliant wife, and he ran off with the family's cook, Mrs. Bullfinch, and settled into a flat with her. Albert didn't care for his wife's writings; he liked to read detective stories instead. He read hundreds and hundreds of detective stories. And now that he was gone, he advised his wife to put aside her brilliant writing, and write the kind of detective story that people who actually bought books might like to read. And buy. Albert even told his wife how she might start her detective story:
""I like stories which begin with a very respectable-looking,.""
Thus inspired, Mrs. Forrester went home directly, and began to write her detective story. When it was published – as The Achilles Statue – it was a great success, and she became famous at last. And wealthy, too.
And, by the way; Albert and Mrs. Bullfinch lived happily ever after also.
The message for me being that if I set out to write a mystery novel, then I should write a mystery novel. Don't try and write something else. I dread the idea of writing my books to a ""formula"" – what Barbara Fradkin calls ""The F Word"" – and I hope I never do that. But there are essential components to a mystery novel.
So, I will start again on my new book. And this time I will start the book by killing somebody. And go on from there: backwards, forwards, and sideways.

Many thanks greatly for revealing this specific info. I'd personally certainly like.",What was the feedback received from the publisher and editor about the author's fourth book?,"The feedback was that the book as it stands now needs much better organization and structure.

"It is a tenant of hockey any time of the year, but one especially important in the postseason: Get pucks and bodies to the front of the net, and if there is contact with the goaltender, so be it.
Turns out the Canadiens have done a better job of that through the opening two games of their first-round series with the Rangers, knotted at one game apiece after two games in Montreal. So when Game 3 commences Sunday night at the Garden, the Blueshirts are hoping to keep people away from goalie Henrik Lundqvist and as far away from the crease as possible.
“I think we have to do a better job boxing out,” winger Rick Nash said Saturday in Montreal, with his team using the day to travel back to New York after a gut-wrenching 4-3 overtime loss Friday night at Bell Centre. “I think we kind of let them have too many rebounds, too many jams. I think that stems from our play at the blue lines. Wingers have to be better at getting pucks out.”
With the Rangers holding a 3-2 lead in Game 2, they couldn’t keep Tomas Plekanec from getting to the front of the net — despite a slash from defenseman Nick Holden that broke his own stick and left him helpless to defend as Plekanec tied the score with 17.3 seconds remaining in regulation. They also couldn’t keep Alexander Radulov from jamming in the winner in overtime, as Mika Zibanejad gave a unsightly effort to keep him away as he jammed one in.
But not only do the Rangers need to defend better, they need to do the same in front of Carey Price if they have any chance of beating the superlative Montreal netminder with any regularity.
“It’s a big topic for us as well, trying to get pucks and bodies there,” captain Ryan McDonagh said. “They obviously had the puck more, second half of the third and overtime [in Game 2]. We’re going to try to do the same thing. You see it’s not always pretty goal, highlight-reel goals. If we find we get one or two more of those, jam pucks at the net, that’ll help us.”
The Rangers recorded 74 hits in Game 2, and though it is a stat kept with inconsistency throughout the league, it was the most they have had in a playoff game since that stat began being tracked in 1997-98. They now have to try to get back to their high-tempo style that carried them through most of the regular season while also not losing the physicality necessary in the postseason.
“When you get into a playoff game, I think there needs to be some physicality there, and I think we’ve done a good job of making sure that we’re answering that,” center Derek Stepan said. “I also think that our team is built on speed and we can find ways to get back to that, as well. We have to find a balance between the two of them.”
With that physicality, there have been a lot of post-whistle scrums — but not very many cheap shots besides the spear Rick Nash took the groin at the end of Game 1.
“Playoff hockey. I think you look around the league, I don’t know if you’re going to see regular season, people stopping in front of the net without a scrum,” Stepan said. “It’s that time of year. I didn’t think there was any cheap shots thrown, it was just a playoff game.”",What is one strategy the Rangers are hoping to improve upon in their upcoming games against the Canadiens?,"The Rangers are hoping to improve their strategy of keeping people away from their goalie, Henrik Lundqvist, and as far away from the crease as possible. They also aim to do a better job at boxing out and preventing the Canadiens from getting too many rebounds and jams."
"I love gardening. I love the sight of flowers. It has healing effect on me. I have a small balcony where I have limited plants on pots. Couple of years back I used to grow flowers but then they dried out as we left for our native for a week or so. Hence I quit growing flowers because I can’t see the plants die. The current plants I have is aloe vera, curry leaf, amaranth, cactus, baby pineapple and 2 show plants. I also have some plants that I grow in vases inside the house. Those are like small stems of decorative leaves. So you see when my parents visit me I ask them to get some leaves or flowers. Just so I can brighten up my home with their smell at least for a day . The flower you see in this picture is brought by my mom. She wanted to see how I will use it for my food photography. And she was pleasantly surprised and happy. She loved the pics.

"The internet was recently awed by the promise of incredible new technology that could help solve our traffic problems—engineers in China had reportedly developed an elevated bus that would allow cars to drive underneath it.
The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB) was tested on the road in Qinhuangdao City on August 2, gaining enormous media and public interest. However, new reports are stemming from the Chinese media that the entire endeavor is essentially a scam.
According to RT, “the ‘road test’ was nothing more than a publicity stunt and that its sole purpose was to drum up more interest among potential investors for a project that would never actually be created.”
Other problems include the fact that the TEB’s designer’s highest level of education was elementary school, most cars will not be able to fit underneath the bus’s 2.1 meter clearance, and the bus itself violates the height limit for vehicles on Chinese roads.
Car News China also noted that the construction of the TEB was shoddy, built with rubber wheels that run on gutters rather than an actual rail system.
The funding behind it could additionally be illegitimate: the company was potentially “misleading investors and crowdfunding their project illegally,” RT reports.
While an extraordinary idea in theory, it unfortunately appears that we are quite some time away from anything resembling the TEB populating our freeways and alleviating major cities’ traffic crises.

He was on bath salts it is more
akin to a cocain high then lsd...
If you stay on it for a few days straight
though since it will keep you up, you will
start going into psychosis and hallucinate.
Reminder to people keep it natural.
Why would you think it was bath salts? Autopsy has not come back yet. Since MPDV (bath salts) are not traceable in drug tests and there would be no way of knowing if he used them in the past, there cannot be any reason to think this unless an autopsy was done.
Is there another reason you think this? The effects of MPDV rarely include psychosis compared to other, more obvious drugs. Plus the dude was pretty well groomed and didn't look like some candy kid looking for a cheap thrill.

The College Cafeteria serves three hot and inexpensive meals a day during Full Term. Service is cafeteria style, and the food chosen is electronically charged to the student's account. A Kitchen Committee, on which there is student representation, monitors the quality and variety of College meals, and the kitchen staff make every effort to accommodate those with special dietary requirements.
Formal Halls
Twice a week there are optional Formal Halls where students are served at table and food is of a high quality. ‘Super Halls’ with themed menus are also regularly held and prove very popular. Often, students will entertain friends from other colleges at these events.
Coffee Shop
The Coffee Shop serves barista-style coffees, sandwiches, snacks and a range of delicious homemade cakes.
Self-Catering
While eating in Hall is an important way to be a part of any college, students are also able to cook their own meals or host dinners for others. Each staircase has one or more basic kitchens or ‘gyp rooms’, equipped with basic self-catering facilities for student use. There are two supermarkets nearby a plus a range of specialist food stalls in the Market Square.

"Adobe Elements 9 to Lightroom 5.3 ===> My experience
Having used Lightroom and Photoshop for a couple of weeks and have done pretty much all there is to do I can still say I am impressed with both programs and I feel it was worth the cash over Elements.
There is some room for improvements for both programs though:
1) Key-wording isn't as easy as it should be with LR 5.3. When you hover over the icon on a picture that indicates a photo is tagged it says ""this photo has a tag"". What a useless piece of information. When you hover over a tag icon it should show a balloon with the tags present on the picture. This is obvious Adobe .... just fix it. Currently you have to scroll though the left keywords panel just to confirm you tagged a picture properly.
2) When you are importing scanned pictures LR has no easy way to change the date from the scan date to the actual photo date. Yes you can go though the menus, but LR really needs a hotkey for this feature or better yet just click on the date to change the date.
3) Why doesn't Photoshop have Blacks and Whites sliders like LR5.3. Honestly, I can usually get the look I want just by messing with those two ... no curves required.
4) In the left metadata panel sometimes capture date, or any date just disappears depending on the picture source .... annoying but you can always edit date from the menu bar.
5) Why isn't there a handle to close all keywords you have expanded in the keyword panel. If you have a lot of keywords this is almost a necessity.
There are many others issues but they are more a matter of work style than functionality.
Where PS/LR shines:
1) On first use I thought the content aware heal tool was crap in LR, but once you learn its strengths it becomes useful. It is no replacement for heal and clone in PS though.
2) Heal and clone seem to work much better than in Elements.
3) I get angry looking back at all the crippling in Elements ... many tasks are much easier in PS and not only the automated ones.",What are some of the improvements suggested for Adobe Lightroom 5.3 and Photoshop?,"The improvements suggested for Adobe Lightroom 5.3 and Photoshop include making key-wording easier in Lightroom 5.3, providing an easy way to change the date from the scan date to the actual photo date when importing scanned pictures, adding Blacks and Whites sliders in Photoshop similar to Lightroom 5.3, preventing the disappearance of capture date or any date in the left metadata panel depending on the picture source, and adding a handle to close all keywords expanded in the keyword panel."

The sharpness is to be seen to believe right down to the corners. The flaring and vignetting is controlled well. The Last word ""Buy it if you can afford it"" ... I bought this when it was 2611 USD incl of taxes and now the price is dropped and I am pulling my hair ... But no complaints, I know the lens is worth the money spent and it will recover for itself some day.
In comparison with our other Nikon “Trinity” Zoom 24-700MM F.28, at 70MM and the same apertures, the smaller sibling slightly won in sharpness, with all other performance aspects pretty much even.
In comparison with our Nikon Primes (85MM F/1.4 and 105MM F/2.8 Micro), while the Primes won in sharpness contests at similar focal lengths, two things stood out from our tests: (1) With the same shutter speeds, this Tele-Zoom came in within 1/3 F stop of the Primes : excellent light transmission capability, and (2) Colors of similar spots in pictures are within a few points of the Primes
(using the Color Sampler tool in Photoshop): exceptional color depth and vibrancy.
Just one minor point, a tripod may be a necessity, even with VR, for shutter speeds slower than 1/40 second.
Conclusion: Expensive but so worth it.
Before buying this lens, I kept asking myself why I needed to spend so much money on just a lens when all I do is take pics of animals at zoos. I think my heart skipped a beat when I hit the ""purchase"" button. But over a year later, I'm still so glad that I bought it.
This lens solved several problems for me that I was having with my 18-200 lens, which were soft focus, chromatic aberration, faster autofocus, edge-to-edge sharpness, and edge-to-edge brightness; and at f2.8, allows faster shutter speeds in lower light.
I've also used this lens on a D800E that I rented. Upon careful inspection in Lightroom, I could see a very small amount of light fall-off around the edges. So slight, that it's easy to miss and even easier to correct in software.
I was tempted to buy the 70-200 f4, but decided against it because I would lose a stop of light. Sure the f4 version supposedly has better VR, but what if you don't need VR? You're still stuck at f4.
With all this said, this lens is big and heavy. It's not a casual lens. You'll be the one accommodating this lens, not the other way around. It took me a few months to become fully comfortable using it and carrying it. I use a BlackRapid Strap (BlackRapid RRS-1BB Sport (RS-Sport) (Black)) to dangle the camera body and lens at my right side, lens pointing straight down.
Some side notes:
From my experience, this lens is waterPROOF, and so is the D7100. I got caught in a downpour here in Florida and the body and lens got drenched. The lens fogged up, the camera's viewfinder filled with water. I put the lens and camera in airtight containers with dehydrated rice for a few days and all the moisture was absorbed and both worked like new!
I've used this lens with and without an expensive clear filter. No difference in quality, so I leave it on. I'd rather have light ""cleaning scratches"" on the filter than on my expensive lens. Without the filter, I would have to resort to my cleaning kit and spend a lot of time carefully cleaning the bare lens. With the filter, I use my shirt!
For best auto-focus results, half-press the shutter button for a few seconds before taking the photo. This gives the VR time to counter the type of vibration it's experiencing in that particular situation.

Nifty & Sensex Hit All-Time High; A Fitting Finale To A Dream Year
Dec 28, 2017 | 05:15 PM IST
Dec 28, 2017 | 05:15 PM IST
Market This WeekThe market started on a positive note on Tuesday as both Sensex and Nifty continued to trade in the mildly higher side but on that day only Sensex touched 34k mark for the first time and Nifty made fresh new high crossing over the 10,540 mark. Nifty midcap and smallcap continued to outperform indices as dream rally continued in throughout the week. By the end of the week, the market continued to trade flat as domestic and global trigger lagged and eventually turned negative one day before last F&O expiry of 2017. On F&O expiry day market continued to trade volatile as stock-specific buying was seen especially in ADAG (Anil Dhirubhai Ambani) group of companies. Movers & Shakers Reliance Communications' Chairman Anil Ambani on Tuesday said the company would sell telecom assets, including spectrum, towers and fibre, worth Rs.25,000 crore by March 2018 to repay lenders and exit the ongoing strategic debt restructuring (SDR) programme. The company in its new avatar as an enterprise-focused business will sell the stake to global investors to cut loans further, he added. Ambani had said that the company's debt would shrink to Rs.6,000 crore from Rs.45,000 crore. Also, the company had reached an out-of-court settlement with China Development Bank which had filed an insolvency petition in the bankruptcy court to recover $1.78 billion, or about Rs.11,460 crore, from the telecom company. Balrampur Chini Mills was the biggest loser in the market for the week as the government of India has withdrawn stock holding and turnover limits on sugar dealers with immediate effect as the demand-supply condition is expected to be comfortable with the estimated rise in production. Key Market Drivers India's goods and services tax (GST) collections fell to the lowest since the tax regime was put in place on July 1. Total collections in November added up to Rs.80,808 crore, down from a provisional Rs.83,346 crore in October. The Finance Ministry is likely to issue the first tranche of recapitalization bonds to public sector banks (PSB) in early January. The government plans to infuse Rs.76,000 crore capital by giving it space in budgetary allocation and through markets, and rest Rs.1.35 lakh crore by issuing recapitalisation bonds. The government has decided to borrow an additional Rs.50,000 crore through dated securities this fiscal while trimming receipts via treasury bills by Rs.61,203 crore between now and March 2018. The Indian banking sector has been classified under ‘Group 5’ along with countries such as Italy, Spain, Ireland, the UAE and South Africa by S&P (Standard & Poor) on the basis of countries economy and industry risk criteria.

The Winter session of Parliament will be ending on January 5, 2018, while debating a number of significant draft legislation. While 25 Bills are scheduled for consideration and passing, 14 are listed for introduction, while a few ordinances are slated to be replaced by acts after the bills are discussed and passed by the two houses of Parliament.

"Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane shared a different view than her predecessor Thuli Madonsela on the terms of reference of the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.
Mkhwebane on Wednesday welcomed President Jacob Zuma's appointment of a judicial commission of inquiry and offered her services to help develop the terms of reference of the inquiry.
Some opposition parties have already voiced their concern about the inquiry's terms of reference, and Madonsela told News24 earlier on Wednesday that the inquiry to be headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo may only focus on state capture allegedly committed by the Zuma and Gupta families.
It was Madonsela's last report, State of Capture , released in October 2016, which eventually led to Zuma appointing the inquiry on Tuesday evening. This, following his failed bid to have Madonsela's remedial action, that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng select a judge to head the inquiry, reviewed by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria.
Madonsela said she had clarity on what the terms of reference should be: what she investigated. ""There is no room to expand the commission to include what was never investigated.""
Zuma urged to give Zondo powers to expand probe
In a statement released on Wednesday, Mkhwebane called for a wider probe into state capture.
.
""Having perused some of the evidence at her disposal and public domain, the Public Protector also calls upon the President to ensure that the ToR are broad enough to include the capture of all state institutions and SOEs (state-owned entities), so that the ability of the commission to uncover the full extent of state capture in South Africa is not constrained in any manner.""
Mkhwebane also called on Zuma to ensure that Zondo has the power to expand ""the issues to be investigated, should any relevant evidence of state capture be brought to him during the inquiry"".
""As part of her responsibility to monitor the implementation of the remedial action, the Public Protector shall be available to assist, if necessary, in the development of the terms of reference, to ensure the full and successful investigation of alleged state capture in the republic.""
'ToR must be framed as broadly as possible'
DA leader Mmusi Maimane said as the initial complainant in the State of Capture report, the party would closely monitor the commission.
Maimane said to avoid inhibiting the South African Revenue Service, the National Prosecuting Authority and the Hawks; andEvery other allegation outlined in the Public Protector's State of Capture
IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa in a statement cautioned Zuma to not try and ""rewrite"" or ""revamp"" the terms of reference for the commission of inquiry as they have already been succinctly spelt out by the Public Protector.
,"" said Hlengwa.
'Truth will be revealed'
UDM leader Bantu Holomisa on Wednesday wrote to Zondo.
""Regarding the terms of reference for the inquiry, the prima facie evidence and remedial actions, as stated by the former Public Protector, should form the basis thereof. It is the work of the former Public Protector, her findings and remedial actions which saw the UDM and other parties in and out of court to force the matter to fruition; we have at last reached that point, where the truth will be revealed,"" wrote Holomisa.
FF Plus leader Pieter Groenewald said the fact that Zuma wants to expand the terms of reference of the initial probe to include everybody involved in all state capture is further proof that Zuma will do everything possible to stay president of the country.
""The commission's terms of reference shouldn't be made so broad that the inquiry can't be done properly and that Zuma escapes in this way,"" said Groenewald.

Multi-genre, Finnish producer, Jesse Oliver is no joke. Typically sailing the waters of international House and Nu-Disco music with his co-captain, Jay Lamar and dropping tunes on globally respected imprints like Discotexas, this month sees Oliver’s second, solo release for the Moulinex and Xinobi helmed label. As a force in the local Helsiniki scene, Jesse pulls double-duty as bass player and producer for local rock band, Vanity Beach, who’s sound is somewhere between Duran Duran and Ministry.
I caught up with the young producer last weekend to chat about his various projects and the horizons of 2014:
[soundcloud url=”” params=”auto_play=false&player_type=tiny&font=Arial&color=ff7700″ width=”100%” height=”18″ iframe=”false” /]
RiCHARD.GEAR: Hey Jesse, thanks for joining me. Could you describe your musical background for us? What are your influences, formal training, how’d you get started, etc.
Jesse Oliver: I played recorder from age 7 until 8 and moved on to saxophone when I was 9. Played the sax until I was 12 and to be honest it wasn’t really my thing. I never practiced enough. I didn’t do anything significant, music wise for a couple of years after playing the sax, but then I started Djing a bit and playing bass just before hitting my twenties. Been a bassist in a few local bands and toured a bit too since then. I did piano lessons for a few years and would like to study it further, I have a nice Rhodes at home to practice on. Did some music theory and finished a music production program about two years ago.
I’ve always been a fan of Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim, Depeche Mode, Massive Attack, Interpol and The Cure. Of course I listen to loads of electronic music too, even Rotterdam Hardcore and Goa Trance as well. Maybe it’s because I’m gettting older and “wiser”, but I’ve been enjoying housier stuff from more recent labels like Exploited, Off Recordings and Local Talk.
RG: How would you describe the Finnish dance scene? Its DJ’s, it’s producers, it’s clubs, parties and festivals… what’s your general impression of the environment?
JO: There are different kinds of parties/scenes here in Helsinki. A bit of everything for everybody. It sometimes feels like there’s too much happening during weekend, considering Helsinki being such a small town. When I go out I normally end up going to Kaiku (). There’s a lot of producers and Djs hanging there. So, I guess in general Helsinki is doing quite fine. I wish the club hours wouldn’t be as restrictive as they are, though.
RG: In your studio, what’s you go to piece these days? Something that you can’t do without when writing a new tune.
JO: Logic and iMac. I’m still running Logic 9 because I don’t like the color scheme of Logic 10. Going to update at some point, but we’ll see when that happens. I might make the move to Ableton, I like to change my workflow from time to time. I do have some nice hardware too… I love my Api 2500 for drum bussing.
Synth wise, Moog Voyager and Juno 60 are my favorites. To be honest, gear doesn’t matter that much because I tend to “sound like myself” no matter what tools I use.
RG: You have a new solo EP coming on Discotexas, but you normally co-produce with Jay Lamar, what was the inspiration to go it alone this time?
JO: I’ve always written tunes alone, I wrote ‘Piece by Piece’ after a club night because I realised I was missing that kind of a tune in my repertoire.
RG: And how did you get connected with Discotexas?
JO: We, Jay Lamar & Jesse Oliver, sent some tracks to Discotexas and they liked them. Later on I sent some of my own tracks and the Discotexas crew also liked them and wanted to release my solo stuff.
RG: Aside from your solo work, you’re a member of the Finish dance-rock group,Vanity Beach. What’s your role in the band?
JO: I play the bass mainly. We just started working on an upcoming album, which I’m going to record, mix and produce.
[soundcloud url=”″ params=”color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]
RG: What can we expect from you in 2014?
JO: Hopefully more “Jesse Oliver” releases, in addition to the EP on Discotexas. I did a remix for Intricate Records which should be available soonish. The new Vanity Beach album should be done this year too.
RG: Open Mic! Anything you wanna plug? shameless self-promotion!!
JO: Check out my Soundcloud! Also, I mixed and recorded a local punk band, WHC. According to Finlands main alternative radio station they are “hipster friendly old school punk”.",What are some of Jesse Oliver's musical influences?,"Jesse Oliver's musical influences include Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim, Depeche Mode, Massive Attack, Interpol and The Cure.

Kenaidan Contracting Ltd (Kenaidan) was selected by the Capital Regional District (CRD) through a competitive selection process to build the expanded Clover Point Pump Station. Kenaidan has more than 30 years of experience building, modernizing, and expanding waterworks facilities within southern Ontario and British Columbia.
Construction on the Clover Point Pump Station is anticipated to begin in early 2018 and will be complete in mid-2020. The contractor, Kenaidan, will conduct further geotechnical investigations in the upper parking lot at the Clover Point Park in early December 2017. In January 2018, Kenaidan will set up a preliminary work site on the west side of the entrance to Clover Point.
The contractor will work with municipal staff to develop a traffic management plan for the Clover Point Pump Station prior to construction starting. More information will be provided about work in this area in early 2018. A key consideration during the construction will be managing potential impacts on the surrounding community. All construction activity will comply with City of Victoria bylaws regarding hours of work and noise levels.
The Clover Point Pump Station expansion will be primarily underground and below the grade of the adjacent section of Dallas Road. The expanded facility will be constructed out of materials that will allow it to blend with the existing facility and surrounding area. It will also include upgraded odour and noise control features, such that there is no discernible odour or noise to residents. The scope of work also includes a number of public realm improvements, such as public washrooms, pedestrian and bicycle paths, bicycle facilities, a public plaza, street furniture and road intersection improvements.
The Clover Point Pump Station was built in the 1970s and is owned and operated by the CRD. The current pump station pumps wastewater directly into the ocean. The expanded pump station will pump wastewater to the McLoughlin Point Wastewater Treatment Plant for tertiary treatment during normal flows and provide bypass pumping to the existing Clover Point outfall during storm events.

"Odd and the Frost Giants had not been inside our house for more than a few minutes before my older boy had it in his hands. I didn't let him read it to himself, though-I wanted to read it to him. And for the next few nights, we were enchanted by the story.
In Norway, long ago, a boy named Odd leaves home very early one cold winter morning, when it was supposed to be spring, but wasn't. After his father had died while off being a Viking, a tree had crushed his leg, and his mother had married a man who did not want him. With nothing left to keep him in his village, he sets off to live alone, as best he can, in his father's old woodcutting hut..
The gods (Loki, Thor, and Odin), trapped in their animal forms, think it's all pretty hopeless, but they have nothing to loose, and Odd doesn't either. So when Odd suggests that a visit to Asgard might be in order, off they go, with Odd riding on the bear's back, to find the rainbow bridge that leads away from Midgard, the middle earth where humans live.
And then Odd must face the Frost Giant. He can't outfight the giant, he can't think of a way to trick him, and he doesn't have any special magical powers or talismans. All he has is a carving his father had begun before he died, and his wits...
I am very fond of Odd. He is smart without being smart-aleky, unhappy without ever whining, brave partly because taking action beats doing nothing, and partly because of his delighted self-awareness that he is living a story:
""As the bear sped up, the cold went through Odd's clothes and chilled him to the bone.
The fox dashed ahead of them, the eagle flew above them and Odd thought, crazily, happily, I'm just like one of the brave lords in my mother's ballads. Only without the horse, the dog and the falcon."" (page 21)
The gods don't come off as well as Odd does. This should not be a surprise to anyone familiar with Norse mythology, and the bickering back-talk between Thor and Loki is delightfully spot-on (Odin, the rather grumpy and aloof eagle, has much less to say).
My nine year-old loved this book. He knows his Norse mythology pretty well, however, and I wonder how much that contributed to his reaction, in as much as he was able to greet Thor and Loki as old friends. I am pretty sure, however, that Gaiman has created a solid enough enchantment to sustain even young readers meeting these gods for the first time. He doesn't try to fit ""An Introduction to the Gods of the Vikings"" into his story, but instead trusts his readers to find their own way in, with a minimal amount of overt explanation. As events unfold, some things are made clear, but other stories and mysteries and magics are only hinted at.
In short, this is a lovely book to buy a child, for winter time reading together under the covers or in front of a fire. It is a lovely book to have on one's shelf. It is a lovely book for those who delight in Norse Mythology. It's hard to predict if this will please ""Gaiman fans,"" because his books are all so different from each other, but those who loved The Graveyard Book will, I think, like this one.
And now I am trying to decide in my own mind if Odd, from this book, and Bod, from The Graveyard Book, are pretty much the same boy in different circumstances....they both provoke a similar maternal response in me.
Here are some other reviews, at Things Mean a Lot, Chasing Ray, and Shelf Elf, and, by way of interesting contrast, reviews by adults for adults at SF Signal and Graeme's Fantasy Book Review.
Odd has been nominated for the Cybils Awards in middle grade science fiction and fantasy, for which I am on the short list committee; the opinions expressed here are entirely my own.
I think I really want to read this. :)

"Posted in FB, but not shared with the folks in control of town. So, here ’tis:
I highly propose that a good test be done on Russell Road.
Reclaim gravel-like “pavement” there now. Grind, add actual gravel, lay it down, grade (you know, with an actual crown), and roll it. I’m not a road agent, and don’t play one on TV… So do what’s called for to create an actual gravel road. There is tons of good info out there on HOW TO RECLAIM AND CREATE A PROPER GRAVEL ROAD.
I’m pretty sure the one-time dirt cart roads were fine in their time. I loved driving down Starch Mill 30 yrs ago, only 1/2 plowed in winter, grass growing down the middle in summer… But, that’s a dust road, masquerading as a dirt road, that should be a gravel road.
PLEASE, someone in Selectman’s board & Road Dept, take a day to research. Do what’s RIGHT. Penny-wise, pound-foolish, does NOT pay off. Tax payers keep losing here!!
——–
Thank you for reading. I understand you don’t have a dirt road project plan. You do have a paved road project plan. Wouldn’t this be a great part of that project? Russell Rd has to be reclaimed soon anyway, I hope.
Kind regards,
Pam Lassen
The Gazette looked up a random “HOW TO RECLAIM AND CREATE A PROPER GRAVEL ROAD” google search and found this which caught our attention. Notice the part in Section 1 where the shape a gravel road is listed as having three elements: crown, shoulder and ditch. We recently traversed some of our “reclaimed roads” and noticed not only no ditch, but the shoulder also sloping in the wrong direction! We assume what applies to gravel roads also applies to paved roads. However, frequently the width of the right of way interferes with a road that’s too wide for the circumstances in the first place.
Former Road Agent Greenwood was on the right track when he started adding stone to the roads… or as the above manual states:
.
However, a berm on the side of the road is not a shoulder and can be blamed on hurried operations
I can agree to a point about the dirt roads, BUT, I wonder if you lived on one if you’d feel the same. Get behind a bus or go on the road after one has passed, if there is no treatment on the dry roads, you cannot see what’s coming or going. You cannot open your windows in the house without the dirt flying in on any breeze. Your car is constantly covered in dust, your tire life is reduced, say nothing of engine filters. And my lungs are not made to filter the road dirt when walking. I’ll take the hot pavement anytime. Just saying

"I had a post ready for today, but when the bombing went off yesterday afternoon….
… and a day that should have been a day of celebration turned into a day of remorse and mourning… I knew there was something more important for today’s post to be dedicated to.
I was not old enough to understand 9/11. I remember the chaos and the repeated showings on the news of skyscrapers falling. I was confused and didn’t know what was going on. But now that I’m older and have witnessed the bombing of Boston…. If 9/11 was anything like the bombing in Boston, I know we need each other to get through this.
I may not live in Boston, but Boston is still a part of this country – a part of home. We are all children of a loving Heavenly Father. We are brothers and sisters. We as a nation and as a people (whether here in the states or across the seas) can come together and help our brothers and sisters in Boston.
Please pray for the victims in Boston. Pray for their families and for those who have lost loved ones. Pray for peace in the world. Pray for love among men. ❤ ❤ ❤
Alone we fall. Together we stand.

Great post, Kat 🙂
SO sad 😦
I remember 9/11 like it was yesterday and all those mixed feelings that i had about it all. I really do feel like it changed the world!
Hopefully we, as a nation, can learn from it and use it, making it a blessing instead of a roadblock. Even the little things really add up. We can become more considerate of others. We can reach out, serve others, and become a friend to our neighbors. We can lift each other up. And, we can do what we can to prevent something like this from happening again. This bombing was awful, but doing nothing about it is worse.",What is the author's message regarding the bombing in Boston?,"The author's message regarding the bombing in Boston is that we need each other to get through such tragedies. They urge people to pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and love in the world. They believe that as a nation and as people, we can come together to help those affected.

Mercedes AMG GT3 lands in 2016
This will get confusing very quickly, so please pay attention. Mercedes-Benz has announced that the Mercedes-AMG GT3 - the racing version of the new Mercedes-AMG GT - will launch in 2016.
That’s a lot of AMGs and GTs in one sentence, but it’s a big bit of news, though not entirely unexpected. At the Paris Motor Show earlier this year, AMG boss Tobias Moers confirmed to TopGear.com that the new AMG GT sportscar would spawn a variety of models.
So here’s one for the Nomex brigade. We’re told that testing of the “new sportscar based on the street version” will commence next year (that’s 2015), with a season debut at the beginning of 2016.
And that’s about all we can tell you at the moment, but for those of you who’ve just shelled out for a racing SLS GT3, fear not: Mercedes will continue to support the big ol’ gullwing even after the AMG GT3’s launch.
It’s been quite the success story for Mercedes too, that racing SLS GT3. Since AMG began the customer sports programme in 2010, the SLS AMG GT3 has achieved some 182 overall victories, 98 pole positions and 930 top ten positions.
In this year alone, the SLS GT3 has scored 34 overall race victories, six titles in championships across the globe, two endurance race victories, 52 class victories, 101 podium positions, 228 top ten positions, 29 pole positions and 416 race starts. That’s… a lot.
So, the SLS’s little brother, the AMG GT3, has some big shoes to fill. The road-going version, as we’ve found out, isn’t too shabby a base, either. Read TG’s road test here. If you’re utterly confused about the Mercedes-AMG GT’s racing version called the Mercedes-AMG GT3 built by Mercedes-Benz, then please, just have a lie down somewhere.

"SLA Boys Program for Spring 2018
Registration opens December 1st
There are several changes to SLA's spring 2018 offerings:
First, SLA is adopting the recently developed Lacrosse Athlete Development Model (LADM) from US Lacrosse, the national governing body for the sport.

In 2018, SLA will be offering both an expanded local recreational 10U, 12U and 14U age groups in 2018, but overall registration numbers and player preference will determine the final shape of the offering at each age group. 6U and 8U will be local rec only and may be combined as required by registration numbers. See the age group eligibility (by birth date) and program summary chart below.
LOCAL RECREATION OPTION
The local recreational playing option will feature small-sided instruction and all games in Stafford and (possibly) Spotsylvania counties. Season runs March through May and will consist of two practices per week and up to 7 games on Saturdays.
6U Age Group: 3v3 (no goalies), modified field (smaller than 60x35 yds), mini or soft sticks, soft lacrosse balls, no protective equipment
8U Age Group: 3v3 or 4v4, modified field (60x35 yds), regular sticks (can be shortened), soft lacrosse balls, full protective equipment
10U Age Group: 7v7 modified field (60x35 yds), regulation sticks, regulation NOCSAE balls, full protective equipment
12U Age Group: 10v10, full field lacrosse (this may be modified to meet the development needs of registered players); regulation NOCSAE balls, regulation sticks, full protective equipment
14U Age Group: 10v10 full field lacrosse (this may be modified to meet the development needs of registered players); regulation NOCSAE balls, regulation sticks, full protective equipment
All first year players must play in the local rec option. Second year players should play in the local rec option, but can play in the NVYLL league with a coach's recommendation and a successful pre-season assessment to one of those teams.
NVYLL OPTION
The Northern Virginia Youth Lacrosse League  per week, an 8-game regular season and a playoff experience. The season runs from mid-February (assessments) through early June (playoffs).
In 2018, participation on an NVYLL level team will require the player to 'opt-in' to NVYLL during the registration process by selecting the, ""Interested in NVYLL"" option. The NVYLL playing option is only available at the 10U, 12U and 14U age groups. All NVYLL age groups play 10v10 full field lacrosse.
UNIFORMS
Another change for 2018 is that members will order their uniforms directly from the manufacturer following during the registration process. Upon successful completion of the registration, the link to our online store with the uniform supplier, Powell Lacrosse, will be contained in the confirmation email sent to the address used during the registration process.
The 2018 uniforms are identical to the 2017 uniforms. If you are a returning player whose 2017 uniform still fits, no purchase is required. New players and those requiring new sizes should purchase the required items. - 24 March (NVYLL); 7 April (Local Rec)
In-season Practices:
Practices are conducted at parks and schools throughout the county...2018 locations TBD;
NVYLL teams practice up to three times per week, local rec teams will practice up to two times per week.

"Massage Therapy Facts for Physicians
Americans are turning to therapeutic massage for relief from injuries and certain chronic and acute conditions, to help them deal with the stresses of daily life, and to maintain good health. In an August 1998 national survey of consumers by Opinion Research Corporation (ORC), 52 percent of the 1,007 adults surveyed said they think of massage as therapeutic and 19 percent said it feels good and is therapeutic.*
Medical professionals are becoming more knowledgeable about the efficacy and benefits of massage and are commonly integrating the services of massage therapists into patient care. According to a national survey conducted by the State University of New York at Syracuse, 54 percent of primary care physicians and family practitioners said they would encourage their patients to pursue therapeutic massage as a treatment. Of those, 34 percent said they are willing to refer the patient to a massage therapist.** And, health insurance companies, realizing the cost savings of massage, may cover sessions with a massage therapist when they are a prescribed aspect of treatment. In the 1998 consumer survey by ORC, of the 15 percent of adults who said they had discussed massage with their doctors, 76 percent reported that the physician responded positively to use of therapeutic massage.*

Working With Massage Therapists Questions and Answers
Q. What is the minimum schooling required for a massage therapist?
A. In some states, this is determined by a regulatory body. AMTA requires minimum training of 500 hours of classroom instruction (at least 300 hours in massage therapy theory and technique, and a minimum of 100 hours of anatomy and physiology). Most states that regulate the profession require 500 or more hours of classroom instruction.
Q. Why isn’t there a national standard or requirement for someone to be a massage therapist?
A. As with most healthcare regulation, this is determined at the state level. Certification by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork is an indication that a massage therapist has the established and required hours of education, has passed a comprehensive written examination, and is qualified to enter the field.
Q. How many states regulate massage?
A. Twenty-nine states and DC currently regulate massage therapy. The number of states recognizing the need for regulation has doubled in the 1990s.
Q. What is the difference between AMTA and the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork?
A. AMTA is the premier professional association representing the massage field. Founded in 1943, it has more than 37,000 members. The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB) administers the National Certification exam and certifies massage therapists who pass the exam and maintain their status through continuing education.
Q. Does AMTA certify or credential massage therapists?
A. AMTA does not certify or credential massage therapists.
Q. Are massage therapists being accepted on insurance provider panels?
A. As health plans recognize the efficacy of massage and its value, as well as the competency of massage therapists, the number of therapists on insurance provider panels is rapidly increasing.
Q. How do I determine what type of massage therapy my patients should have and whether they need to see someone who specializes in a particular massage or touch technique?
A The best approach is to find a qualified, professional massage therapist who can determine and/or recommend massage appropriate for the situation.
Q. If I send a patient to a massage therapist, will payment be the patient’s responsibility or will insurance reimburse for it?
A. This will vary with the patients’ health plans. More health plans now regard massage therapists as recognized providers. Check with the patient’s insurance, as with all referrals, to determine how payment will be coordinated.
Q. What does a massage therapist do that a physical therapist can’t/won’t do?
A. A physical therapist concentrates on rehabilitation of physical damage caused by illness and injury through the use of various devices and exercise. A massage therapist focuses on the normalization of soft tissues affected by stress, injury, and illness through the use of manual techniques that improve circulation, enhance muscular relaxation, relieve pain, reduce stress, or promote health and well-being. Massage therapists have extensive training specific to their field. Physical therapists have training in basic massage, but not the specialized education of massage therapists. AMTA requires and recommends that a professional massage therapist have a minimum of 500 hours of training in massage and related subjects.

"Can we first just address that I'm finally in a pumpkin patch after years of wanting to go to one? I've had an amazing family involved day picking out some pumpkins and Autumn for me so far is bloody amazing! Now, into the post!
I love Autumn and I when I think of the perfect day in Autumn I always just imagine walking around the city of York on a day off, coat on, Boyfriend in hand whilst we drink hot drinks and explore. That almost makes me sad because we no longer live in York so this Autumn is going to be completely different, it's the first October we've lived in our house in the little village we're in. I'm trying to see that as something exciting because it's all going to be a new experience for us both and with this being my favourite time of the year I don't want it to disappoint. I love the casual/warm feelings of Autumn, how on the weekend I get excited about putting my coat on and going for a walk! The crisp feeling of the air, falling leaves and how I get so excited to take photographs in my boots. I feel warm thinking of finally putting the heating on, drinking hot drinks and just the idea of having a huge explore as the skies starts to get dark. October so far is completely different from last year so at the moment I'm finding it hard to really get into the season spirit when it's raining every day and the temperature has just suddenly dropped to freezing. I'm missing the slow transition where I go from jacket to coat (at the moment it's just rain coats all the bloody time) or the warm sun set which is super early but makes my heart skip. Instead of letting the crap weather at the moment get me down I've been thinking about all the things I love to do in Autumn and my ideal day of how I like to spend it.
It's definitely all about the walks to the cafes or coffee shops for me, I used to love doing this with friends and family when we lived in the city so I can't wait to do it now on my days off. In our village there's a number of cute cafes which are of course super cheap because they're in the country side, so I can't think of anything better than on the weekend putting on my fur coat or scarf and casually strolling to the café. I want to feel the cold breeze on my face slowly, but then have the warmth of the sun as it creeps up into the sky. I'm going to take a small detour through the park because it's going to be beautiful. The suns going to shine through and the ground will be covered in leaves and it's going to be photo heaven. Joel's definitely going to tell me off for taking ages getting snaps of my shoes in the leaves, but then we'll be on our way to the café, walking past the veg shops and florist until we get to the café and hear the chime of the bell as we enter. If we ever go into town or to a city I love getting a hot chocolate or a sweet tea from Starbucks and just taking a walk, York's so beautiful but there's little gems with living in the country side.
I love the change in my home décor. I'm on a budge this year but I have enough stuff anyway to give our home a little make over. I love this time of year because I change pretty much everything in my house. I bring out different scented candles to make it smell more homely than the fresher scents I use in summer or spring, along with the colour scheme of my living room getting a little warmer. Of course in October I go all out with the Halloween decorations, but just in September I keep it a little light with orange leaf prints and musky candles. I drag all the blankets out of storage and scarfs become the perfect items for flat lays.
I hate having to start wearing tights, but one thing I love about Autumn fashion is how I start to experiment more with wearing layers. I love to wear trousers or culottes with shirts and jumpers, or even dresses over shirts, I always build up my outfits when it comes to the season and I'm definitely excited for it. We all have that trusty coat and mines been my black faux fur for years, it is time for me to get another coat, but there's always something nostalgic about getting my favourite coat out of the cupboard when the cold wind starts to roll in. Whilst I love boots I love swapping my sandals for shoes like creepers or boat shoes, the boots coming more into my winter wardrobe, but I can't wait to start experimenting with smart shoes. I love everything about my autumn wardrobe, from the olive greens to the mustard colours and of course there's always more black in my outfits.
Whilst I do love fashion and putting together a good OOTD, I'm very lazy so the idea of whipping off my clothes the second I get home and putting on my PJs gets me excited for autumn. I love early nights, whilst it does take away my motivation and makes it really hard to take photographs when there's no natural light, I love getting all snuggled. In September the sunset starts to happen around 8pm, but by then I'm already full from my tea, in my comfies and settling down for a tv series or film. I love spending quality nights in with my partner just out of the cold.

Everyday I'm noticing the season taking over and it gets me so excited for things like Halloween, Farmers markets, walks on the market, Bomfire night, so I'm definitely in my element right now. What do you love about Autumn? What are you up to this October to embrace the season?

‘Tomorrow we start to act’
“Don’t think we’re going to wait weeks, months or years,” Rodriguez.
“It doesn’t matter where they meet, they’re installing a fraudulent institution,” said Freddy Guevara, the National
Assembly’s first vice-president, at an opposition demonstration in eastern Caracas that drew only a few hundred protesters, one of the smallest in months.
Worldwide condemnation
An increasing number of foreign governments have sided with the opposition, refusing to recognize the constitutional assembly and further isolating Maduro’s government.
Foreign ministers from several South American nations said they will gather Saturday in Brazil for an emergency meeting amid speculation they could decide to evict Venezuela from the Mercosur trade bloc for violating its democratic norms. Venezuela was suspended from the group in December.
The opposition boycotted the July 30 election.”
The U.S. State Department said Thursday the assembly was illegitimate, reiterating a call by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for Maduro to leave office or face unspecified actions to “return the government processes back to the constitution.”
Assembly to target existing congress
Cabello said that in one of its first tasks, the assembly plans to target the opposition-controlled congress, known as the National Assembly, and almost certain to be denied..
One opposition lawmaker, Henry Ramos Allup, said this week that if forcibly expelled from the legislative palace, the National Assembly could potentially hold its sessions at another site.
Despite questions surrounding the vote, Maduro all but ensured nothing could stop the government from seating the new assembly.

“They are bent on plowing ahead with this power grab,” Shifter said, “and this is not going to stand in the way.”
Two more judges appointed by the opposition-led National Assembly have sought refuge from the government, this time in the Panamanian Embassy and diplomatic residency in Caracas, the Panamanian government said. Four had already sought refuge with Chilean diplomats in the capital.
Antonio Ledezma, the former Caracas mayor hauled out of his home after midnight Tuesday by heavily armed security, was returned to house arrest Friday.

Servants of the God-Emperor
This weekend sees a pair of releases from Black Library shedding light on some of the Imperium’s foremost defenders in the age of the Dark Imperium.
‘Watchers of the Throne: The Emperor’s Legion’ pulls back the curtain on the protectors of the Throneworld itself, as the Custodian Guard and the Sisters of Silence take the spotlight. When Terra faces the gravest threat it has experienced in millennia – a host of daemons determined to tear the heart from the Imperium – it falls to these deadly warriors to defend the Emperor and all that he built. The novel is written by Chris Wraight, who is no stranger to the Imperial Palace, having written a tale of intrigue and adventure set there in ‘The Carrion Throne’, and this promises to be another fitting exploration of all that Terra has to offer.
‘The Emperor’s Legion’ is available to order now in hardback, or to download straight away in eBook and MP3 audiobook formats (you can also get the latter in the Black Library audio app), or if you fancy something, well, fancy, you can get the lavish special edition. This glorious artefact features bespoke artwork on a decorative leather-effect hardcover, and inside you’ll find marker ribbons, an introduction by Chris and a bonus short story! Chris has hand-signed each copy, of which there are just 1,000 available. You can only get this special edition from the Black Library website, and we suspect it’ll sell fast, so you’d better hurry!
What if you just have to own the special edition, but don’t want to wait to read the story? We’ve got you covered, with a bundle offer – buy the special edition and get the eBook half price, ready to download and read while you wait for your fancy pants books to arrive and take pride of place on your shelf.
Also out this weekend is ‘Eye of Night’, an audio drama by Gav Thorpe featuring the Inquisition. You may remember this from Audio Week a few months ago, where it was released in three instalments – well now it’s available as a single MP3, as well as on CD. It stars Inquisitor Greyfax, one of the newer agents of the Inquisition to be introduced to Warhammer 40,000, as she is tasked by Roboute Guilliman with recovering an ancient and deadly artefact being used by the forces of Chaos to further their infernal schemes. Her quest will unite her with an inquisitor long thought dead, and pit her against one of the founders of her order, now a servant of darkness…
Download ‘Eye of Night’ now from blacklibrary.com and the Audio App, or order the CD – perhaps along with your copy of ‘The Emperor’s Legion’. Both of these titles will start shipping next week.

"Nov 14, 2012 Comments Off on Lathrop plans: little preservation, big TIF
Lathrop plans: little preservation, big TIF
Three new plans for redeveloping Lathrop Homes fall far short of the project’s stated goal of historic preservation – to the point that developers will pass up tens of millions of dollars in federal historic preservation tax credits.
Instead, they plan to ask for $30 million or more from a new TIF district.
The plans have garnered widespread local opposition due to heavy increases in density and congestion.
CHA and Lathrop Community Partners will present three scenarios at open houses (Thursday, November 15, 3 to 8 p.m., and Saturday, November 17, 12 to 4 p.m.) at New Life Community Church, 2958 N. Damen.
At 4:15 p.m. on Thursday, Lathrop residents and neighbors will hold a press conference to denounce all the scenarios and the lack of any meaningful community engagement.
Already thirteen neighborhood associations have signed onto a letter to CHA from Ald. Scott Waguespack (32nd) calling for rejection of all three plans due to excessive density and lack of public participation.
And Tuesday, Ald. Proco Joe Moreno (1st) sent an e-mail blast announcing the open houses and saying, “I do not believe that any of the individual scenarios on the table are an acceptable plan to move Lathrop Homes forward.”
Total demolition
In fact, one of the scenarios would almost certainly fail to win regulatory approval.
Dubbed the “Delta Greenscapes” scenario, it calls for demolition of all of Lathrop’s low-rise, historic buildings.
But since Lathrop was named to the National Register of Historic Places in April, any demolition involving federal funds must be approved by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation. And CHA will use federal funds to cover the costs of rehabbing and operating public housing at Lathrop.
“Clearly, demolishing everything would not meet preservation guidelines and would rarely be an approveable action under the federal program,” said Michael Jackson, chief architect for preservation services at IHPA, who notes that nothing has been submitted to his agency.
Approval might be forthcoming in cases involving extreme deterioration and functional obsolescence, but “I can’t see that logic applying here,” he said. “The essence of the Lathrop project is historic preservation. It’s been identified as a historic property, and the development team has been given that direction.”
Indeed, the RFQ under which LCP was selected states that the developer “shall consider preservation one of the priorities of the revitalization.”
“What they’re pulling is a typical developer’s trick,” said Jonathan Fine of Preservation Chicago. “We’re going to show you something so god-awful that when we walk it back to something slightly less god-awful, the community will think it’s won something.”
Developers prefer TIF
Despite the RFQ’s request for developers with experience using historic tax credits, none of the plans are likely to qualify for the credits, which cover 20 percent of a project’s costs – in this case, tens of millions of dollars. That’s what developers told aldermen in August, said Paul Sajovek, Waguespack’s chief of staff.

"A few days back I was sharing with you 10 Amazing Things About Poland that you might not know. Seems to me I should also do my homeland justice and present you some rather interesting things about my hometown, about Iasi. So without any further ado let me get into that:
1) Iasi is the 4th biggest city in Romania, when it comes to the number of people living in it, just after the capital: Bucharest Cluj Napoca and Timisoara. The city grows even bigger if you take into account the number of students that come to the Uni's here. The faculty of Medicine is extremely popular and the ""Alexandru Ioan Cuza"" University in Copou is also very attractive to young people worldwide.
2) The first printed books in Moldavia (the region) was done in Iasi in the year 1643. You can still visit the house where it was printed - it is a small museum close to the Palace of Culture.
3) Iasi was set on fire 3 times - first in 1513 by the tatars, 1538 by the ottomans and then in 1686 by Russians.
4) Iasi was the capital of Moldavia for almost 300 years (1565-1859). It was moved from Suceava by Alexandru Lăpuşneanu.
5) Vasile Lupu created the very first school in Romanian language - you can see it on Stefan cel Mare Street, at the end towards the Palace of Culture. He also established a printer / press in the church Trei Ierarhi - also located on Stefan cel Mare Street.
6) Iasi was mentioned the first time in a commercial privilege emitted in 1408 by the ruler of Moldavia, Alexandru cel Bun. That makes the city over 600 years old ;)
7) In 1930 the number of Jewish people in Iasi was actually half of the number of Romanian! There were: 63.168 Romanian, 34.662 Jews, 980 German, 918 Russians and the rest up to 102.872 were other nations, in low numbers.
8) Iasi has three oldest and biggest Botanical Garden in Europe!
9) It is very similar to Rome in the sense of being named the ""legendary city of the seven hills"" - namely Cetatuia, Galata, Copou, Bucium, Sorogari, Repedea and Breazu.
10) The Grand Hotel Traian in the Union Square is ""The"" posh hotel in town. It was recently refurbished and it is in itself a gem. The building is from the 19th century and it is an architectural masterpiece of the French architect Gustave Eiffel - inaugurated in 1882.
Yours very much sincerly,

The Kamloops, B.C., mother hasn't seen her daughter, Jessica ""Jessie"" Foster, since Christmas 2005, when the then-21-year-old came home for the holidays.
Jessie had been living in Las Vegas and told her mom she had become engaged to be married.
""We thought Jessie was living a normal life in Las Vegas, but ultimately, that's not what was going on at all,"" Grant told CTV's Canada AM Monday from Vancouver.
""We spoke to people who knew Jessie down there and they told me she was actually afraid of this person [her fiancé].""
Grant would later learn that Jessie had been living with 39-year-old Peter Todd, who was well-known to police as a pimp. What Grant.
Though police began an investigation into the Calgary woman's disappearance, no trace of Jessie has even been found.
What is worrying about Jessie's case is that at the same time she disappeared, so did three other young women, in similar circumstances. The other three were all eventually found dead.
But Grant doesn't believe her daughter is dead. After learning more about Jessie's life in Las Vegas through the work of a private investigator, Grant now has a theory about what happened to her.
""Jessie was actually a human trafficking victim. And she had fallen victim to these people,"" she says.
""And when she tried to leave, they just took her away somewhere.""
They depict Jessie as she might look at age 26. In one of the images, Trepkov drew Jessie as she would look if her appearance had been altered by her captors, in order to disguise her. Her blond hair is darkened and her skin is tanned, here hair is shown straight and short on one side, and long and wavy on the other.
The second image shows how Trepkov thinks Jessie might look if she was being physically abused by human traffickers.
""I made her look very tired, thinned, worn out, a bruise on the lip, dark circles under her eyes. I disguised her with darker hair in a split hairstyle,"" Trepkov told Canada AM.
""Human trafficking is a $1 billion industry. She would be prime, because she's blond and petite. They would kidnap her and make her look different.""
Grant hopes someone will see the sketches and recognize Jessie and help find her daughter.
Grant firmly believes Jessie is still alive somewhere because she says she can feel it in her heart.
""I've talked to the mothers of those other women who were found deceased and one of them in particular told me that she knew even before her daughter's remains were identified that she didn't think her daughter would ever be found alive. She said this came from deep in her heart. We call this our heartstrings. My heartstrings are still connected to Jessie. It hasn't changed in terms of me feeling that she's still alive,"" Grant said.
""A mother knows in her heart when her child has died, and I haven't felt that at all. And that gives me the greatest hope.""
Anyone who thinks they have information about the disappearance of Jessie Foster is asked to call Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.

River Beauty
River Beauty
Sitting at the marina early in the morning
late past midnight artistically dawning
colours of the sky unfolding by the minute
purples pinks and yellow a heavenly pallette
Early morning mist along the banks does drift
reeds and wildlife revealed as it starts to lift
Wood ducks wild ducks every where around
siting tight on their nest hardly making sound
Kookaburras laughing as the wrens twist and turn
Ravens in the willows watching out for worms
Peace and tranquility surrounding riverglen
until speedboats and kneeboarders come flying round the bend
Kookaburras silent their discovery they now fear
as people in the water charge around and cheer
River wrens return to their nests to sit and hide
as the wild life on the river yearns for quite time
Evening in its glory returns with glowing sun
people with their boats and boards return to where their from
Kookaburras war cry rings around the trees
as the river wrens and raven twist and play in breeze

Re: River Beauty
You've written a poem that captures my heart, and your photo looks as though it might have been taken at my boyhood home in Maryland. I love the natural images and characters you use to tell your story. Very well done. Thanks for sharing.

Re: River Beauty
Aw Sue, The river one of my favourite places to be sitting on the banks or floating on a boat and moving slowly through the countryside. The sounds, smells (sometimes with manured fields Pooooo) and sights love it all.
The poem says it all very good Sue.

Springfield, MO
Rachael Jarosh is the new student in charge.
In fall 2016, Jarosh took the helm as president and CEO at Springfield-based Enactus succeeding Alvin Rohrs after 34 years. Rohrs is staying on through the end of 2016 to make the transition smooth for the organization that serves to develop the entrepreneurial and service skills of some 69,000 students on 1,710 university teams across 36 countries.
While Jarosh still is navigating her freshman year at Enactus – formerly known as Students in Free Enterprise until 2012 – she is no novice to the demands of the job. She brings to Springfield 22 years of experience in branding, communications and philanthropy. Jarosh has worked as a philanthropic consultant the past three years for her Minneapolis-based venture Isles Strategies LLC, has served as president of the Pentair Foundation, the charitable arm of global water, fluid and thermal management firm Pentair PLC. At Pentair, she also led global corporate communications. In Minneapolis, she also has four years of experience as a senior counselor with marketing firm Carmichael Lynch Relate.
With Enactus teams stretching from Springfield to China, India and Russia, Jarosh manages a nonprofit that has an operating budget of roughly $20 million, with donations and grants bringing in nearly $15 million annually.
She hopes to build on the efforts of Rohrs and others who have grown Enactus to what it is today.
“Investing in students who take entrepreneurial action to improve the world for us all is no small task; our greatest opportunities are to build on this success and to ensure continual improvement and long term sustainability,” Jarosh says via email.
Her experience with the Pentair Foundation, in particular, prepared her for her new role in Springfield.
“Working with employees around the globe on the most important issues in their own communities to working on a multiplayer partnership that has since delivered safe, clean water to more than 3 million people – and is still doing so today was remarkably rewarding. Today, I am lucky to do the same each day,” Jarosh says.
In Enactus’ competitions, business leaders serve as judges, and their job is to rank teams based on how well they employed business concepts to improve the standards of living for those in need. Jarosh’s introduction to the organization came at the Enactus World Cup in 2009, when she met Rohrs for the first time, as well as Jack Shewmaker, the late Wal-Mart executive. It was Shewmaker’s passion for Enactus that drew her to the Queen City. While Jarosh says there is still a lot to learn, she knows she’s in the right place.
“Enactus’ work to nurture students with a head for business and a heart for the world is as compelling, as necessary and as relevant as ever,” she …",Who succeeded Alvin Rohrs as the president and CEO of Enactus?,Rachael Jarosh succeeded Alvin Rohrs as the president and CEO of Enactus.
"Investment in new marinas and staging key events are helping to put Turkey on the map when it comes to sailing.
The statistics are certainly surprising. Turkey is the third highest producer of luxury yachts in the world, and with an unspoilt coastline of 8,000km and 352 Blue Flag beaches, it’s easy to see why has become one of the coolest sailing destinations in the Mediterranean.
There is a tradition of regular international boat races and festivals throughout the year as well as the serene ‘Blue Cruise’ on a traditional wooden boats alongside a breathtaking coastline. There are lots of anchoring points which offer fantastic settings for swimming and diving, as well as secret bays, local fishing villages and modern resort towns to explore.
Recognizing the economic benefits Turkey has embarked on a new infrastructure program, new marinas are opening all the time – the latest plans include marinas for Dalaman on the Mediterranean coast, Oren on the Aegean coast (close to Bodrum and in Istanbul). In total Turkey has 36 international standard marinas and 12 municipality operated marinas with a total capacity of 14,230 floating berths and 5,605 hard standing.
At present.
Newly opened marinas include Cesme Marina and Teos Marina in Izmir, Didim Marina in Aydin, Kas Marina and Mersin Marina in Antalya, and West Istanbul Marina and Yalova Marina in Istanbul.
The country also hosts a variety of international festivals and regattas throughout the year, including the Bodrum Cup. A unique international yacht regatta and annual tradition, it celebrates the end of Turkey’s cruising season and unites Bodrum’s charter fleet with private wooden yachts from around the world. The exciting competition is held every October, and is exclusively for classically constructed wooden vessels, both for skilled yachtsmen and novices, who can stow away as passengers or join the crews for the last adventure of the sailing season. For more details visit.
Other festivals and regattas in Turkey include:
• International Yachting Festival and Race in Marmaris (March and October)
• International Bosphorus Cup in Istanbul (May)
• Istanbul Channel Regatta – International Offshore Races, Marmaris to Rhodes (June)
• International Istanbul Optimist Week (June-July)
• IODA World Team Racing Championship and IODA World Sailing Championship in Cesme (July)
• International Turkish Navy Cup in Istanbul (July)
• International Istanbul Sailing Week in Istanbul (August)
• International Ataturk Dam Sailing Competition in Sanliurfa (September)
• Bozburun International Gulet Festival in Bozburun, Marmaris (October).",What are some of the factors contributing to Turkey's popularity as a sailing destination?,"Turkey's popularity as a sailing destination is due to several factors including its investment in new marinas, hosting of key events, an unspoilt coastline of 8,000km, 352 Blue Flag beaches, and a tradition of regular international boat races and festivals.

"My name is David Bahm and I'm a graphic designer and fine artist originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2017, my wife and I relocated from Parker, Colorado to the Tampa, Florida area to be closer to family and escape the snow and cold. I am currently freelancing for a local client, but always open to additional freelance or other opportunities.
My experience is primarily with printed materials, but also website design and some html coding. Below are examples of projects I've created during the past several years. Click on each thumbnail image to see more details.
Just two of the many catalogs I've designed during my 17 years of employment with the company. The Industrial Magnetic Solutions Catalog has 40 pages, and the Permanent Magnetic Materials Catalog has 24 pages (click on bold text to view in new window). Additionally, I photographed and ""Photoshopped"" many of the product images in both catalogs.
AOM is a subsidiary of Master Magnetics, Inc. and prints customers' logos and information on colorful and unique magnetic products. The Ads on Magnets Catalog has 20 pages (click on bold text to view in new window). In addition to layout and design, I photographed and edited many of the images in this catalog.
Various print ads I've designed that have appeared in national retail, point of purchase and industrial trade publications.
As part of the 40th anniversary celebration, I was asked to create an anniversary logo, update a product logo, and completely redesign the company logo. During 2017, the new company logo will gradually replace the former on packaging, marketing materials, business cards, envelopes, letterhead, several magnetic assemblies (embossed), the company website and more.
A variety of illustrations I created for website use, retail packaging and trade show graphics.
This is one of my favorite projects. Each year the company mails these items to about 1,500 customers and vendors. The postcard is glossy cardstock, and the calendar is printed directly to flexible magnetic sheeting.
Additional Holiday Card and Calendar designs can be seen here (click on bold text to view in new window).
For Master Magnetics' 40th anniversary, I was asked to design two timeline presentations for social media. The History of Magnets and the History of Master Magnetics were a lot of fun to create (click on bold text to view in new window).
I illustrated all of the elements for displays used at the NBM (National Business Media) Shows in Indianapolis and Philadelphia. The purpose was to give attendees ideas on how they could use magnetic sheeting in point of purchase and advertising applications. Click here for more details.
A new company logo brought with it a complete redesign of around 200 retail packaged products. Here are updated packages I designed for the Magnetic Tool Holder and Magnetic Cup Caddy (click on bold text to view in new window).
A large percentage of the redesigned retail packaged products were clamshell insert cards. Here are just a few of the insert cards I designed (click on bold text to view in new window).
I designed large fabric and retractable display graphics for various shows the companies participate in (click on bold text to view in new window).
The guild's largest show draws thousands of attendees during the last weekend in August every year. I've designed ads, posters and the brochure for the show for several years, but in 2014 I illustrated the theme and prepared art for t-shirts, plus designed tri-fold brochure, shopping spree postcard and various newspaper ads (click on bold text to view in new window).
I've promised to continue to design these items for the show after my relocation to Florida. The committee chairman said she would resign if I didn't. It's nice to be needed!
I illustrated the theme for this year's show and designed the show brochure, postcard, poster and newspaper ads, plus prepared art for t-shirts.
Pieces included letterhead, envelope, business card and more.
Full color tri-fold brochure and large format display graphics I designed. Images were stock photos.
BookCrafters is a business that assists authors in self publishing. The owners were fellow members of the Parker Artists Guild and asked me to design over a dozen book covers for their clients.
The state's. The sign in the photo is located on Hwy. 337, about 40 miles southeast of Albuquerque.
The publishers have relied on me to create nearly all of their quarterly magazine covers during the last ten years. Many of their sponsors do not have the resources to design their own ads, so I create those as well.
The New Mexico Route 66 Association gave me the opportunity to create, design and edit this publication. It started out as a 4-page black and white newsletter. When I relinquished my duties to another designer nine years later, it had expanded to a 32-page glossy magazine in full color.
Various images I've created while freelancing for Wasatch Photonics.
Design and maintenance of 220+ page website.
The address is magnetsource.com
The magazine publishers asked me to serve as their webmaster. I completely redesigned the site and gave it a more trendy look versus the previous site. I'm also responsible for quarterly content updates.

"The.""
On this December day, the family room is strewn with musical-minded clutter. Three guitars sit on stands. Brennen's mandolin rests beneath her T-shirt's logo for the Gibson Café in Nashville. In a rare moment, the unlikely cowgirl's bare feet are missing their rumpled tan cowboy boots. On the floor lies a timeworn, four-string banjo, played by their grandfather during country's heyday. Photos lie on the coffee table: An infant Seth sleeping in a guitar case owned by his father, Don, the athletic director at Moorhead High. Brennen and Seth playing at a fair.
""It all started really with our dad's old records, really Asleep at the Wheel, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson,"" says Seth, an aerospace student at the University of North Dakota. ""Dad wouldn't admit it, but he plays decent guitar, and I remember him playing bluegrass and country from the time we were very little.""
At 13, Seth started plinking around on the guitar, learning tunes like ""Froggy Went a' Courtin."" But the early '90s grunge scene caught hold of the teen stronger than patchouli stench.
In a classic example of tomato, tomahto, Seth's electric guitar writhed with Nirvana and Led Zeppelin riffs in his buddy's garage, much to the police's chagrin. Meanwhile, Brennen sat alone in her room, singing and picking acoustically along with The Cranberries and Jewel. She began to play in local swing and progressive rock bands.
Those kind of artistic differences would never lead to Osmond family musical bliss. Their one true connection country western music had become a joke to both of them.
""We just got turned off to it; looking at the country scene back then, Billy Ray Cyrus break dancing in white tennis shoes on CMT, I mean, come on,"" Brennen says. ""Of course we thought we hated country music, because we only heard the junk the music industry was telling us was country music.""
The siblings eventually found some common ground with blues and old rock, helping to form short-lived cover group The Edgar Stevens Band. They played some rough numbers, including opening for the now disbanded Mr. Vanderbilt at 309 Broadway, where two of three customers were a man dancing with a sedated woman in a wheelchair.
""I was just 15, and that's a bit tough on the ego,"" Brennen says. ""But you just gotta laugh. I figure, if one old guy is watching us, digging our music, it's worth it.""
California cowboy Dwight Yoakam gets credit for Seth and Brennen's return to the old school.
""Two years ago, we went to see Dwight at the fair: It was probably the best day in my life to date,"" Brennen says. ""I mean, I started to warm up to old style country before then, but when I saw Dwight, I was like, whoa. And that's about all I've wanted to listen to since then.""
Since Seth had started school in Nashville, he also had been bit by the bluegrass bug. They began performing as a duo.
""Making that jump from despising country to that's what you like and perform, it's been really neat to watch,"" says father Don. ""They like to credit me with things, but everything they've done has been because of their hard work and enthusiasm and responsibility. My wife and I have just sat back and enjoyed the music.""
A regular act at places like The Trentino, 25th Street Market and the Cork n' Cleaver, growing audiences come out to hear Brennen Leigh play Hank Williams tunes like it's 1949 and they're fresh out of Tennessee.
Their lineup also regularly sweeps through Mississippi Delta blues, Texas swing, Appalachian mountain songs and Irish drinking songs. ""We're Irish, so we feel at home doing those songs,"" Seth says. ""Plus, Celtic and country music have a lot in common,"" Brennen adds. ""One: alcoholism. Two: getting your heart broken. Three: the Lord. The instrumentation is also similar, lots of mandolin, banjo, violins, and there's always those happy little melodies.""
A common shortcoming in fledgling groups, Seth admits Brennen Leigh lacks original material. They now perform just five to 10 originals at shows, mainly country laments like ""Jessie James"" and honky-tonk tunes like ""No Way, Jose,"" which Brennen wrote after getting hit on in a San Antonio bar.
Despite that, the duo's opportunities and accolades are becoming more frequent.
""The music isn't the kind of thing you would think most people would enjoy, but they do it so well, people love it,"" says Peter Roufs, Trentino owner. ""And they are truly as pleasant as they are talented; it's like Donny and Marie Osmond all over again.""
The twosome has been asked to perform in the annual Celebration of Women and Their Music show at the Fargo Theatre in February. A solo Brennen recently sang a snippet of ""Tonight, the Heartache's on Me,"" to win a singing contest at the Wild Horse Saloon in Nashville.
Ironically, Brennen says she has difficulties in her high school a capella choir and dreads music class graduation standards, which include a report and performance. ""I asked my teacher if I could do a bluegrass piece, and it turns out the state Legislature mandates that bluegrass has a difficulty level of zero, so I can't,"" Brennen says. ""How insulting.""
This year presents the proverbial fork for the siblings. Brennen has decided to apply to Belmont University in Nashville, alma mater of country stars like Brad Paisley and Lee Ann Womack. All hinges on a performance audition at the end of this month.
The siblings are committed to performing together, but Seth waffles about whether that will be here or in Nashville after he graduates next year.
""Most guys (in Nashville) playing in the street for tips could smoke me,"" he says. ""I'd have to do it for the pure love of music. Call me in 10 years and I will probably still be working at some waffle house,"" he laughs.
""But really, I might wait awhile to pursue the flying thing. I guess the only thing I don't want to do is look back and say 'You know, Brennen, we could have done so much more with our music.'""

"Sunflowerman is a creative force from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Headed by illustrator Matthew Miller, Sunflowerman has taken four years of creative immersion in Atlanta and a Lakeshore upbringing to give the world a fine-art fashion experience.
The name Sunflowerman has grown from a child-hood persona to a brand identity. As a young child I would attend a summer camp every summer. There a was a giant field for recreation and a lake in the middle of the woods for cooling off in the afternoons. One particluar year there was an acitivity revolving around skits. Everyone had to pull an item out of a bag and incorporate it into their skit. When, as a young boy, I pulled out a shower curtain covered in sunflower prints there was no debate in my mind. There was no thought in dissent against the only truth that could be Sunflowerman.
Sunflowerman has been illustrated and iterated for years. A character that began on a whim took form. Friends participated in the discovery of who Sunflowerman would be. Through High School and through University the name stuck and the name grew. The name Sunflowerman often evokes thoughts about super-heros and super-powers. People want to know what he stands for and why he exists. I can only say that Sunflowerman is a symbol for joy and a desire for community.
What is born is a passion for people. People are interesting and worth while. People wear clothing, People invent culture and People are beautiful.
Art is made by People.
Whatever is created is art. Created well or poor, for good or for bad it is art. Writers, philosophers, marketers and gardeners are all artists. To be human is to be a part of the act of creating art.
People wear Clothes.
Clothing is beneficial in many ways. At times it is a covering of protection against chill winds or seering heat. At times it is a symbol of authority or camaraderie. For whatever reason all around the world people wear clothes.
Clothes are Fashion.
As a symbolic gesture to the community people wear clothes in specific ways. There is business attire and sportswear. There is high fashion and stree style. Economics, culture, and social awareness set the boundaries. Clothes make people aware of who they are and show what they believe. Fashion is the way people represent themselves in communities. Clothes are Fashion.
Fashion is Art.
Fashion is the environment people create with the clothes they have. That space is a specific and intentional creation. What is created in that space for the sake of fashion is art.
The Sunflowerman logo is intentionally textural. A combination of a watercolor mark and vector lettering describes Sunflowerman's modern intention with traditional processes. Sunflowerman illustrates for ads, magazines and brand campaigns using traditonal watercolor techniques and modern print and digital reproduction.
Sunflowerman is a design agency focusing on Men's Fashion Illustration for Business-to-Business work and product design for Consumers. Beginning in Atlanta Sunflowerman began illustrating portraits of local gentlemen dressed in dapper uniform. From there the work grew out to boutique aesthetics with clients like Q Custom Clothier, H.Stockton and Trio Custom Clothier. Along with TheFollowFashion.com, Sunflowerman took to blogging to generate a weekly Men's Fashion Illustration to high-light fashion brands and icons.
The modern man has had a return to fashion consciousness. With this return is a look to the styles that have brought us to where we are now- Three piece suits and fedoras, bespoke tailoring and leather shoes. Vintage is our heritage. It is what will get us to the next evolution in fashion. We remember reading books (or we know that our parents did), we remember black and white and we remember the fashion that moved our culture for centuries.
Book-Page Fashion is the response to nostalgia and the joy in classic styles. It is for the man who enjoys looking as fresh as his grandparents and as current as his icons.
•The Black and White Collection
The first Book-Page Fashion collection. It stripped down the nature of fashion to simple shapes and lines. The Black and White Collection was a chance to engage with fashion at a primal and simple level. The movement and the silhouettes speak with a sense of simplicity and refinement.
.
•The Nostalgia Collection
The second Book-Page Collection. It takes a leap forward with color but points the viewer back to a time when suits and ties were an Everyman's attire. Bowl Caps, Cigars and Double-Breasted jackets Show us where we are now by talking to us about the past.
.
• The Fab Collection
This third and current collection is Fabulous. Collaboration and Experimentation are the pillars of this collection. The sentimentality of nostalgia is replaced wth the joy and excitement of being a part of the present. You will see what can only be described as a fashon movement.
Fine-Art meets Fashion

"Piddinghoe Wharfe
Husband and wife team of Brighton photographers. Stephen Nunn was born at his parent's home at 75 Alexandra Cottages in Beckenham on April 13, 1878. His father, Thomas Nunn, a compositor (printer), had been born at Colchester in Essex and was in his mid thirties. His mother was Charlotte Nunn, formerly Turner, who was in her mid twenties and hailed originally from Buckinghamshire. Stephen's elder brother, Thomas H. Nunn, was born in 1875.
At the time of the 1901 census, the Nunn family was still living at 75 Alexandra Cottages. Stephen was working as an architect's assistant. When the 1911 census was held, Stephen had become an architect in his own right, and had moved with his father to 75 Edward Road in Penge.
Stephen married Constance Mary Thompson at St Mark's Church in Clerkenwell in London on March 11, 1915. He was living at Amwell Street, Islington, at this time. Constance had been born at 25 Ulysses Road in Fortune Green, west Hampstead on September 22, 1891, and was therefore much younger than Stephen. Her father was William Thompson, a master builder, born in about 1863, and her mother was Mary A. Thompson, born in about 1862 in Camden Town. She had at least two younger sisters and a brother. According to Raymond Guy (Constance's grandson), her father ""had a working relationship with Stephen. William introduced Stephen to his daughter, and the rest is history""! The couple chose Barmouth in North Wales for their honeymoon.
Stephen and Constance moved to Brighton, most probably just after the War. From 1922 to 1930 they are listed in Brighton Directories as photographers or photographic artists at 23 Ship Street. Eventually they needed more space for their growing family and business and decided to move. From 1933 to 1938 their address is given as 77 Preston Drove, Brighton.
Raymond Guy has found a postcard of the Gilbert & Sullivan character, Nanki-Poo, which was mailed in 1908. The photograph is credited to Stephen J. Nunn, which indicates that he had already taken up photography, presumably initially as a hobby. Raymond has also acquired a much later portrait postcard of Miss Catherine Ferguson, an actress with the Doyly Carte Opera Co., which was published by Parkslee Pictures and is labelled ""Nunn. Brighton"" in the corner. It seems probable that with the passage of years Stephen's hobby began to take up more and more of his time, evolving into a regular business that grew eventually to supplant architecture. Constance was also a talented photographer. Raymond's mother, Sylvia M. Guy (formerly Nunn), remembers being told that her mother and father were both members of a photographic club in 1915-20, which had an outing to London Zoo. Constance's inspired photograph of a peacock at the zoo fanning his tail won first prize in a competition.
In 1926 Stephen published a real photographic postcard of the Centenary Procession at Holy Trinity Church in Ship Street, Brighton. The black and white photograph lacks a border. The caption, handwritten in capitals within a rectangular frame at the base of the photograph, ends with the words: ""Nunn Photographer, Copyright"". A sepia-tinted card of Rottingdean, labelled on the back ""Nunn. Photographer, 23 Ship Street, Brighton. Close to G.P.O."", is also likely to date from the mid or late 1920s, as is an undated view of the cast of the Dorothy Kennard Operatic Society taking a bow on stage at the end of a performance of ""The Quaker Girl"" at Brighton.
During the 1930s, Stephen and Constance issued some high quality and attractive real photographic cards of churches and villages around Brighton. A card of Pyecombe Church found by Peter Booth is particularly atmospheric, perfectly capturing the bleakness of a cold wintry day. Other cards of the same vintage feature the lower Ouse valley, including Piddinghoe (at least 7 cards), Iford (a fine harvest scene), Southease (at least 3 cards), Kingston Church, and Southover Church at Lewes. The photographs, which are borderless, have good tonal contrast. They often show clouds, which suggests that they were taken well into the 1930s after film sensitivity greatly improved. Both black and white and sepia versions of the cards are known. They are labelled on the back: ""Nunn's the photographers; 77 Preston Drove, Brighton"", which helps confirm a 1930s date. The earliest postmark seen dates from January 1935.
Several of the Piddinghoe cards show the Alert, a picturesque three masted schooner, tied up at Every's Wharf, unloading what is likely to have been pig iron (Peter Bailey, Newhaven in old picture postcards, Vol. 2, 1984, European Library, Zaltbommel, The Netherlands, page 75). The Alert was built at Runcorn in 1885 and converted into a motor yacht in 1938, only to be broken up during the Second World War (Michael Langley, Sussex shipping - sail, steam & motor, 2004, Middleton Press, Midhurst). It has been suggested that the photographs of the Alert may date from around 1932.
From about 1933 until about 1938 Constance's unmarried sister, Kate Thompson, ran a sweetshop with her father at 22 Cliffe High Street in Lewes. It is tempting to imagine that the Nunn Ouse valley cards were sold in the Thompson shop. Hikers used to stay in Lewes, and would have been enthusiastic customers for artistic views of the valley between Lewes and Newhaven. Also the Nunns might have visited the Thompsons at weekends and then gone walking along the Ouse, armed with a camera, catching a train back from Southease (or Newhaven, if they covered enough distance). Sylvia Guy remembers that they had no car and enjoyed walking. Judging from the variety of Piddinghoe cards, it is likely that they were sold not only in Lewes but also in the shop in the village.
Stephen and Constance Nunn retired in 1939. Constance had developed severe arthritis of the hands, which prevented her from continuing her work of re-touching and hand colouring the photographs that Stephen took. He died in Brighton in 1949, followed by Constance in 1957. They are survived by the youngest of their three children, Sylvia Guy, who lives in Melbourne, Australia.

"Like Attracts Like. Why This House Never Sold
As humans we are all attracted to those who share the same values, likes and dislikes. This is a basis assumption and truly most of the time this tenet runs true.
This same basic assumption applies to real estate. We all look for neighbourhoods where residents for the most part are very similar to ourselves. Whether you cognitively or emotionally make the decision to dismiss the idea of “like attract like” then be prepared to enter very unfamiliar territory. If you take this gamble…then be prepared for the consequences.
There was a great property for sale which was about a kilometer directly east from Toronto’s Beaches neighbourhood. It was an older home but what it had going for it was that it was almost two acres and it had a unobstructed view of Lake Ontario as it sat directly on the top of the Scarborough Bluffs. It sold for 2 million back in the spring of 2006 and it was the highest price ever in that neighbourhood.
For those of you unfamiliar with the Scarborough Bluffs there are strict building requirements due to the unstable nature of the bluffs. So if the buyer was hoping to build townhouses, sever the property or construct a condominium it would never be approved. All you were left with was to build a single family home and so that is what the developer decided to do.
However this was no ordinary build and the old house was demolished and a 10,000 sq ft home with a 3,000 ft garage took its place. It was an ultra modern design with high in finishes and of course a great view of the lake. In fall of 2008 the house was put on the market…for the price of only $5.5 million it could be all yours.
The builder had a serious disconnect and did not adhere to the basis assumption of “like attracts like” which would ultimately financially cripple him. So much so that he was forced to leave the country to escape the angry mob of creditors.
Don’t get me wrong,there are some fantastic homes on Scarborough bluffs. In 2008 a house on the bluffs was around a million with a great house maybe getting up to $1.5 million. So thinking you would be able to attract a buyer willing to shell out $5.5 million was simply unrealistic.
A buyer who is considering a $5,00,000 plus home in 2008 would not be looking in the Scarborough bluffs. For those with that type of cash in 2008 they would be contemplating Forest Hill, Rosedale, Oakville, York Mills or a Bridle Path address. `Like attracts like`so if you are shelling out over $5 million then your expectation would be your neighhours` homes to be in the same price range.
The house history goes like this:
- The builder hired one Toronto`s high-end brokerages who is known for their ability to sell exclusive homes.
- With no offers at $5.5 million the brokerage dropped the price to $4 million but still no buyers.
- It is now spring 2009 and a new brokerage has been taken on and the house is listed at $3.7 million.
- By the end of August still no deal even at at price of $3 million.
- It is the fall of 2009 and the house is now under power of sale and a new brokerage hired with a new price of $2.9 million.
- As 2009 came to an end it did not sell and never came back onto the market.
It is now the summer of 2014 so you must be curious what ever happened to this place? Here’s some pictures of the house when I walked by yesterday.
This house has never been lived in. It sits abandoned by the creditors and even the security company hired to keep an eye on it have ceased to come around.
The house will never sell as with the roof leaking and water in basement I suspect it has become a breeding ground for mold. The only things living here are some birds and racoons who have made their way in.
This property has now become land value. Any potential buyer would be definitely doing due diligence thought, just to wade through the myriad of liens past creditors have secured on this place will be a Herculean task.
There are always basis assumptions in real estate and for those who disregard those tenets then be prepared for the consequences.
Hi Michael, You’ve been nominated as “The Most Knowledgeable Realtor” in Scarborough! Contest runs Aug 1-31. Congrats!",Why did the house on the Scarborough Bluffs never sell despite its attractive features and multiple price reductions?,"The house on the Scarborough Bluffs never sold because the builder did not adhere to the basic assumption of ""like attracts like"". The house was priced significantly higher than other homes in the area, making it unattractive to potential buyers. Additionally, the house was built on unstable land with strict building requirements, and over time, it fell into disrepair with a leaking roof and water in the basement, making it unsellable."
"Legal Polish English translatorPolish English translatorPosted by Fiules Mon, October 09, 2017 12:15:34
Law is concerned with human behaviour. Although different societies encourage different forms of behaviour all human beings have the capacity to behave in any way prescribed, on the condition we do understand what the law requires us to do. The same applies to legal translation, which in order to be successful in terms of communication must incorporate target language-oriented text-normative equivalents.
Legal translators are usually ‘left to their own devices’ in making their decisions as to the right stylistics and tone to be adopted in translation. These decisions are usually based on comparative analysis of random parallel texts, which may prove to be a time-consuming and tiresome activity.
This ‘introduction’ aims to offer practical information regarding the conventions and norms which are characteristic of legislative texts. It is also designed to aid translators in their work by offering a practical comparative manual of the Polish and English drafting styles and other useful information on legal translation.
Legal norm.
A legal norm can be defined to contain a normative statement that produces some legal effects. Any legal norm must convey information in order to fulfil its function of communicating standards of behaviour. Consequently, a norm serves as a scheme of interpretation. The problem of the legal norm has also been discussed in terms of ‘legislative sentences’ which consist of the following elements:
– fact-situation (Tatbestand) which specifies the conditions under which the particular rule operates – in other words, it gives conditions of application of a given norm
– statement of law (Tatfolge) which prescribes the action to be taken and by whom in the event the conditions constituting the fact-situation are met
Fact-situation in English legislative sentences.
The statement of law, which specifies its modality, is always in the main clause (or clauses), whereas the elements pertaining to the fact-situation are more flexible, being formulated as adverbial modifiers in a subordinate ‘if’ or ‘where’ clause. The clauses which express fact-situation can be introduced in English by conjunctions such as ‘if’ (jeżeli, jeśli), ‘on condition that’ (pod warunkiem, że...), ‘provided that’ (pod warunkiem, że..., o ile...), ‘providing that’ (pod warunkiem, że..., o ile...), ‘so / as long as’ (dopóki..., tak długo jak..., pod warunkiem, że...) and ‘unless’ (jeżeli nie..., jeśli nie..., o ile nie..., chyba że...). In the case of English legislative texts, however, legal rules are being formulated mostly as conditional sentences, with ‘if’ – clauses and ‘where’– clauses introducing the fact-situation.
Fact-situation in Polish legislative sentences
The clauses which express fact-situation can be introduced in Polish by conjunctions such as jeżeli, jeśli, w przypadku gdy, w wypadku gdy, pod warunkiem, chyba że, o ile, w razie. See the following examples:
jeżeli = ‘where’ / ‘if’ / ‘embedded fact situation’
Jeżeli wspólnik nie uiścił dopłaty w określonym terminie, obowiązany jest do zapłaty odsetek ustawowych... . (KSH Art. 178 § 2)
Where a shareholder fails to make an additional payment by the specified date, he shall be obliged to pay statutory interest... . (CCC1)
If a shareholder does not pay the additional contribution within a specified deadline, he shall pay statutory interest... . (PCCC)
w wypadku gdy = ‘when’
Przepis powyższy stosuje się odpowiednio w wypadku, gdy umowa została zawarta w imieniu osoby prawnej, która nie istnieje. (KC Art. 39 § 2)
The above provision shall correspondingly apply when a contract has been concluded in the name of a legal person which is non-existent. (PCC)
pod warunkiem = ‘on condition that’
Stosowanie niebezpiecznych substancji i niebezpiecznych preparatów chemicznych jest dopuszczalne pod warunkiem zastosowania środków zapewniających pracownikom ochronę ich zdrowia i życia. (KP Art. 221 § 3)
Hazardous chemical substances and preparations may be used on condition that measures are taken to protect the health and life of employees. (PLC)
chyba że = ‘unless’ / ‘save as’
Jeżeli akcjonariusz nie dokonał wpłaty w terminie określonym w §1, jest on obowiązany do zapłacenia odsetek ustawowych za opóźnienie lub odszkodowania, chyba że statut stanowi inaczej. (KSH Art. 330 § 5)
If the shareholder fails to make the payment on the date specified in §1, the shareholder shall pay statutory interest on delay or damages, unless the statutes provide otherwise. (PCCC)
Save as otherwise provided in the company articles, a shareholder who has failed to make payment by the date referred to in paragraph 1 shall be liable to pay statutory interest for the default, or damages. (PCOCPAC)

"Five days ago you explored the suspicious-looking shop of a coffin maker and found a group of vampires hidden in the attic. The vampires killed one of your companions and chased off the rest of you. Fleeing to the burgomaster’s mansion in terror you discovered that the vampires had stopped following you. You spent the night in the mansion awaiting the safety of daybreak before venturing outside again. You then spent several days searching in vain for signs of the missing vampires who had left the shop and apparently moved their resting places to different, unknown locations. A day later, while continuing your search, you heard screams coming from the town’s church. Investigating, you discovered the church was under attack by the same vampires that had attacked you and that people were fleeing the church. The vampires attacked the church and the priest inside it. You saved the priest from certain death and drove off the vampires, returning to the burgomaster’s mansion to report what had happened. The next day, most of the townsfolk, along with many of the town guard, rose up in anger and marched on the Burgomaster’s mansion in an effort to kill him. Your party intervened and convinced the mob to spare the burgomaster’s life. In return, you gave them assurances that the burgomaster would never again rule and that Brick would instead become the town’s burgomaster and eliminate all the festivals. when making this deal you also made a deal with the burgomaster telling him that you would spare his life and keep the townsfolk from lynching him as long as he assisted you in providing advice on ruling and the town’s taxes and finances and such. Brick then decided to spend the next few days with the former burgomaster to learn from him and take over his duties. While he did this, Mort and a few others set off to investigate the strange fisherman who kept going to the lake and not returning with any fish. They discovered the man was under a strange trance and followed him to the lake where he then tried to get into a boat with a bundled-up girl. Freeing the girl from his clutches you then decided to take her to safety. She said that her father could be found at a Vistani camp near town. While traveling toward the camp, the girl has become sullen and started to act strange. You have just brought her to town and you are now preparing to take her home, calming her and assuring her that she will soon be with her father. Stopping in briefly to report your findings to Brick, you have now gathered up the girl and are setting out again on the road to take her back to her father at the nearby Vistani camp. As you do so, a large human approaches you. He is over six feet tall and very muscular, a young man, you guess about 18, outfitted in old, antiquated armor you don’t recognize and carrying a shield. A warhammer hangs from his belt and a crossbow is strapped to his back. Around his neck he wears an amulet fashioned to look like a shield with a hammer emblazoned on it. His hair and eyes are dark brown in color. He introduces himself, saying his name is Luther and he has heard of you and your most recent battle with the vampires, and that you are hoping to defeat Strahd and leave this realm. “Well, I would like to join you,” he says. “If you’ll have me. I wish to leave this world, too. My parents came from another world 18 years ago, a different one than yours, and they died when I was young. I’ve lived in this nightmarish place ever since, and I want out. I don’t care where. Anywhere but here. I can be of help. My father taught me about Krom, our god, and told me bits and pieces of our world. Taught me to fight. I have never seen their world, but that is how I got all this:” he points to his equipment. “This was all my father’s: the armor, weapons, amulet. It is he who taught me to speak to Krom, though the connection feels strained here and sullied by Strahd’s repressive magic.”
Have Brick’s uncle Amdol step in with a gruff, commanding voice. He says, ""A brave enough lad, sure enough, and big… Hmfff…any help is welcome, that’s for sure… but definitely wet behind the ears. One nibble on his neck will drop him dead like a fainting maiden, I recken. I say he stays to the back of our group and out of the way. ""
Have Ismark add in a lisp, “I’ll watttch over him. He can ssstay in front of me, in casthe theirs an ambuth.”
As the others begin to add to the discussion, Arabelle, the girl they are escorting, butts in and looks at him strangely and says “Yes, it is him…I see it now.” What she means by this you are not sure, but then she suddenly begins to convulse and goes silent, falling to the ground and continuing to shake, frothing from the mouth and uttering strange words, her eyes rolling into the back of her head.
What do you do?",Who is Luther and why does he want to join the group?,"Luther is a large, muscular human who is about 18 years old. He is outfitted in old, antiquated armor and carries a shield, a warhammer, and a crossbow. He introduces himself and expresses his desire to join the group because he has heard of their recent battle with the vampires and their hope to defeat Strahd and leave the realm. He wishes to leave the world as well, as his parents came from another world 18 years ago and died when he was young. He has lived in the nightmarish place ever since and wants out. He believes he can be of help as his father taught him about their god, Krom, and how to fight."
"We all know that squash is good for us. But how many of us really venture out of the “butternut squash soup” or “side-dish of squash” phase? Well, it’s time to get out of your comfort zone. I want you to stuff it!
Do I have your attention?
Good, because you’re going to love this!
Today, I made stuffed squash. The squash was similar to an acorn- you could easily use acorn, butternut, or something similar that you find at the Farmers’ Market or local store.
STUFF IT! SQUASH
(Makes 4 mini-servings or 2 decent entrees)
1 spinach & feta sausage link, chopped into small pieces
1 C. fresh spinach, washed and chopped
1/4 of a small onion, chopped
2 T. chopped garlic, adjust to taste
1 tsp. olive oil
2 acorn squash, small
1 1/2 C. cooked brown rice
1/4 C. feta
3 T. parmesan, grated
1 small slice sourdough bread, lightly toasted
1 tsp. italian seasoning
1 tsp. basil
1 big splash of white wine & splash of milk (that’s a cooking term, right?)
Cut squash in halves. Scoop out seeds. Steam on stove or in microwave (I did microwave- there it’ll steam for 6-7 minutes. Be sure to but a bit of water in each half so it does dry out.) Meanwhile, heat a pan over medium heat. Add olive oil, garlic, sausage, and chopped onion. Turn heat down to low-medium once the onions have turned a golden brown. Add the splash of white wine, spinach, and the italian seasoning and basil. Stir to coat all the pieces. Cook for a minute, then add the brown rice, only 2 T. of the parmesan, all the feta, and a big splash of milk. Reduce heat again to low, softly simmer for about 5 minutes, checking to make sure sauce stays smooth and doesn’t stick to the pan. While this is simmering, tear up the slice of toasted sourdough into small pieces. Put half of it into the rice & sausage mixture. Then, scoop out just a bit (about 1 small spoonful) from each half of squash. Add this also to the rice & sausage mixture. Do not skip this step- it adds a sweet creaminess that you can’t get otherwise! Next, put the halves in a glass casserole dish. Divide the mixture among the four halves. Sprinkle the remaining sourdough slice and the leftover 1 T. of parmesan on top. Place in the oven at 375 for about 10 minutes. Serve and enjoy (maybe with another “big splash” of wine?).
Now, aren’t you glad I told you how to “stuff it”?
Oh! This is a lot like the stuffed squash I used to make when you were little! It’s really yummy with cranberry orange sauce.
Is it? I’d like the recipe for that, too. This would not be good w/cranberry orange sauce because of all the other strong flavors. But maybe as a side dish? I also made lemon/pepper/garlic green beans. It was really, really good. Let me know if you make it!",What are the ingredients used to make stuffed squash?,"The ingredients used to make stuffed squash are spinach & feta sausage link, fresh spinach, a small onion, chopped garlic, olive oil, acorn squash, cooked brown rice, feta, parmesan, a small slice of sourdough bread, italian seasoning, basil, white wine, and milk."

The ""Corn Growers Guidebook,"" a virtual book on the World Wide Web (), was created by Purdue University's top expert on the plant and the crop's biggest fan, Robert L. Nielsen. He designed it to offer every imaginable fact about corn -- or link to other Web sites that pick up where it leaves off.
The Guidebook is split into five ""chapters"" -- Timely Tips, Management Tips, Corny Experts, Other Corny Sites, and Corny Curiosities -- all containing information aimed at corn growers in Indiana and the rest of the Eastern Corn Belt. Each chapter leads readers to a multitude of other corn-related Web sites that address all aspects of raising corn from preparing the soil to marketing the grain. Topics include fertilization; planting; plant development; harvesting; storing; fighting plant diseases and insect pests; and deciding how long to store the grain before selling.
The Other Corny Sites chapter, for example, contains links to 15 other Web sites such as the Corn Information page maintained by North Carolina State University, the Corn Refiners' Assn., the home page of the Nebraska Corn Board, and Extension corn publications by Ohio State University.
Nielsen, a Purdue Cooperative Extension Service agronomist, says he'd like the Guidebook to be a ""one-stop shop"" for on-line farmers to visit when they have questions about corn.
""It's not meant to be only a Purdue collection of information,"" he says. ""I have tried to collect as many Web documents from colleagues at neighboring institutions as I could find by surfing the Web, and I've sent out e-mail asking colleagues directly for URLs of links that I've missed.""
Nielsen will continue to update links and their corresponding documents to keep the Guidebook current. ""A Web site like the Guidebook has a tremendous opportunity to pool the information and knowledge that is available from all the state Extension corn specialists in the region and -- maybe more importantly -- our colleagues from other disciplines such as entomology and plant pathology,"" Nielsen says.

"I mentioned earlier on the blog that we had all taken on some projects during our break from publishing HBM. For me, this meant working a little on video game writing ideas and a little on nothing at all. Then, Duane, Vincent, and I decided to write a truly collaborative piece. For those who don't know, Issue 3 of Here Be Monsters (called ""Where Cities Tread"") was made up of three stories that were all set in the same world. We'd designed the concept together, but each story was still written by the author on his own. During the summer though, we started on a story that was actually written by all three of us.
To do this, we used Google Docs. It allowed us to write on the same page at once, comment on eachother's writing, all while chatting from our computers at our separate houses. I'd known about the tool before this, but to see it in action was pretty incredible. During our first session, we were brainstorming all kinds of ideas. Characters, themes, rules about the story, publication plans, everything was pouring out faster than we could have done around a kitchen table (our usual meeting room).
There was even some healthy debate going on about ethics, religion in fiction, all sorts of things. And, keep in mind, this is with 3 passionate writers, so the fact that we were able to keep it to ""healthy debate"" is a testament to how well we get along and work together.
The plot was slower to come together than some of the other parts, but we had enough to start with. So, each of us began writing from a separate point in the story. I was doing a scene between two characters, going back and forth, when I got stuck. I wrote ""I'm stuck"" on the screen just so that the guys knew why I'd stopped, and then the amazing thing happened. Vincent picked up right from where I'd left off and continued the scene. He stayed true to everything I'd written so far but brought the story forward in a way I wasn't expecting. And I was totally on-board with it.
For those of you who are writers, or even other artists, you can probably imagine how scary it could be to work together in this way. You see all of eachother's mistakes before they can be corrected, you're required to buy in to other people's ideas and hope they buy into yours -- But this worked. Really really well. We all ended up tagging in and out like this as we formed the first few scenes of the story. It was so exciting.
Sadly, the project did get put on hold, but that's okay. It led us back to Here Be Monsters and a new issue. Also, it proved that we could do it. I don't doubt that we'll pick it up again. Whether it will end up as an HBM publication of some kind, I don't know, but it was too fun to not follow through on.
Thanks,
Alex",What tool did the authors use to collaboratively write their story?,The authors used Google Docs to collaboratively write their story.
"-  Ten Must Have Trends For Spring
New York Fashion Week may have been sometime in September, let's face it, the likelihood of you remembering a fraction of what sashayed down the runway is pretty slim. Perfectly forgivable, but with February upon us, and the big spring melt only mere months away, this is the perfect opportunity to get a little refresher. Spring 2013 is shaping up to be one of the most interesting seasons for fashion in a very long time. Get glam, get graphic and go bold with these top ten tantalizing Spring trends.
Automatic Monochromatic
There is nothing more classic than black and white, but this spring, designers are shaking things up with edgy seams, peek-a-boo cuts, and strategically placed detailing. Every woman loves versatility and monochromatic is a design that effortlessly transcends the notion of trend and season, giving you all year round wearability.
Peek-a-Boo
Your date night wardrobe line-up is about to get a serious overhaul because for this spring season, skin is in! Edgy peek-a-boo cuts are a plenty and designers are giving you the option to be as daring or as modest as you wish. Perfectly placed sheering, sexy slits, and saucy separates are certainly one way to ring in spring, not to mention bring a little sass to the endless number of mundane mid-week date nights you've got lined up!
Short Suits
The short suit is the epitome of office chic and go get ‘em gams! Sure, pantsuits exude a certain sense of power and prestige, but a short suit says, ""I mean business, but I'm fun!"" From gauzy cottons to luxurious silks, the short suit is the new power piece. The color palettes are as varied as the styles which is good news for you, because it means that transitioning your look from spring to summer will be a breeze.
Get Graphic
Last year it was bold, deco and ethnic prints, and this season it's all about channeling your inner child with a twist. Graphic cartoon prints have made their way from fashion editorials, onto the department store racks and up and down the streets of LA, New York and London. Classic cartoon imagery from the golden fifties to edgy comic book graphics are all on show this season, and make for fantastic personal statement pieces.
Sunglass Statement
For the past couple of seasons, designers and stylists have been working feverishly to get us all glammed up in statement jewelry pieces. It wasn't unheard of to build your entire outfit around a particular piece of jewelry, and this season, it's all about the peepers. Say goodbye to boring and, hello to sunnies with big bling, bright colors and unusual shapes.
Now You Sheer It
Shed the modesty ladies, it's all about being daring and bold this spring season. If you're looking to take that peek-a-boo look to the next level, sheer is clearly one of the hottest trends going. From breezy chiffons to barely-there-silks, live a little and let yourself bare it all or just enough in a sheer piece.
Life in Technicolor
Last season we were all loving the bright color-block trend and for winter, palettes that included bashful berry's and captivating cobalts set our wardrobes ablaze. This spring, we're getting yet another flavorful taste of the rainbow with rich navies, dazzling purples and gorgeous greens. Give the gray's in your wardrobe a season off, it's all about color!
Slip into Something Slinky
Every woman has that signature little black dress, right? Well, it might be time to give your LBD the night off and opt for something a little less Audrey Hepburn and a little more Boudoir Betty! The slip dress is making a fierce comeback and is the perfect solution to a last minute romantic night on the town. Think you can only don this in the evening hours, think again. This little gem is a fantastic day dress, just pair it with a blazer or cardigan and voila, daytime diva.
From Brocade to Beadery
Luxurious brocades, metallic hardware and embroidery could be seen everywhere these past few months, and it seems as though the adoration for embellishment isn't going anywhere. Get earthly this spring with one of the hottest trends, beading. From simple beaded trim, to full beaded blouses, we're getting back to our crafty yet fashionable roots.
Sport a Skater
The sport dress or ‘skater' dress as the Londoner's call it, made it's way into our wardrobes earlier this year, but is just now hitting the mainstream with a vengeance. The ultra feminine design is fun, flirty and delightfully distracting. Keep it casual or glam it up, it doesn't matter, you're going to want a handful of these to keep on rotation this season.",What are some of the top fashion trends for Spring 2013?,"The top fashion trends for Spring 2013 include monochromatic designs, peek-a-boo cuts, short suits, graphic cartoon prints, statement sunglasses, sheer pieces, bright colors, slip dresses, beading, and skater dresses."
"The article (not available online until Sept. 1) showcased the power of Netflix to connect unknown movies to actual movie theaters and explores the possibility that the company will expand its reach into actually producing independent films. But that's not what caught my eye -- rather, it was the story of how the company did a profit-sharing deal with the makers of a romantic comedy called Nice Guys Sleep Alone. Enter Neflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, who told the film's director ""Send me 500 DVDs. Every time it rents, we'll pay you something.""
""An awful lot of people started renting this no-name title with zero marketing budget,"" (director Stu) Pollard says. ""As a result, it was picked up by HBO.""The article doesn't really linger on this point, but to me it said something of fundamental importance about the future of all sorts of independent media. Because what Netflix has done for independent film is what the Web needs to do for independent comment: apply informatics techniques to connect content to its natural audience.
We've already taken the first step, providing all sorts of ways for creative people to express themselves in public. We've got blogs and free websites that let us speak our minds, indulge our passions and share knowledge. We've got Flickr and Zooomr and others for sharing photos, plus YouTube and sites like Lawrence.com to help us ""publish"" our videos and films.
But if a blogger rants and there's no one there to read it, did she make any sound? For all of Chris Anderson's talk about the future of niche media and The Long Tail, the volume of new content is so large that, even with the best modern search engines, I have no reliable way of finding the portion of that content that most interests me. Rather than finding new writers, I wind up wearing RSS grooves to a stock list of A-List bloggers. Because we lack the proper 21st century tools, 20th century mass-media business models continue to thrive on the Web and The Long Tail remains more of an abstract concept than a solid business plan.
As I wrote last month on Xark, the expansion of the read-write Web has created an un-met demand for real-time information tools that scale to the size of the modern mediascape. In other words, what I really need is a tool that spots content that will interest me, personally, as it is published, no matter who wrote it. Right now, when it matters.
Which brings us back to Netflix.
If you're a Netflix user, and you have been for any length of time, the service you get now is likely far better than the service you got when you first signed up. At sign-up, you picked movies for your queue the 20th century way: You browsed through lists of movies by genre, release date and critical ratings. There were lots of movies to choose from, but few of your choices were all that surprising.
But Netflix is successful because it asks you to rate the movies you watch, and it learns from your preferences. Other sites -- most famously, Amazon -- do something similar, but nobody does this as well as Netflix. This is in part a function of volume: the company has collected more than a billion movie ratings, with a per-person average of 200.
With rich data like that, the company can develop sophisticated profiles to anticipate preferences and tastes. ""It can tell you that you like The Godfather because you love family immigrant pics, and I liked it because I enjoy gangster flicks,"" Sarandos says. ""So the next film suggested to you will be Avalon, and the next one for me will be Scarface.""In other words, had Blockbuster agreed to let Pollard put a copy of Nice Guys Sleep Alone on its vast video store shelves, the odds are slim that the film would have ever found its audience. Nobody had ever heard of the movie or Pollard, and unless its box randomly caught someone's eye, it would be doomed to gathering dust. But by being included in Netflix's recommendation system, anyone with tastes that matched the movie's profile found out about it.
Not blanket, expensive, annoyance marketing in which money drives audience, but marketing as a service to the user.
Everyone wins.
This is the spirit of the web as it could be, but there are enormous hurdles involving privacy, technology, intellectual property, investment and pure, unreasoning human stubbornness between here and there. Yet there's almost no doubt in my mind that this is one of the fundamentals of the new information economy, a concept that cannot be avoided.
Not surprisingly, Dave Winer gets it, although he's writing about it in the context of advertising:.Guys like Winer made all this possible, but it's now time for the Informatics guys to step in and start building the tools that will make sense of the info-torrent Winer and others created. We can help them by thinking about the legal, ethical and economic issues that will surround these tools. We can pave the way.
There's a popular New Age axiom that says ""We are our choices."" In the future, on the Web, this will be literally true. And that's a good thing.",How does Netflix's recommendation system help connect unknown movies to their potential audience?,"Netflix's recommendation system asks users to rate the movies they watch and learns from their preferences. With this data, the company develops sophisticated profiles to anticipate preferences and tastes. This way, even unknown movies like ""Nice Guys Sleep Alone"" can find their audience if their profile matches the tastes of the users. Instead of relying on random selection or marketing, this system serves as a service to the user, connecting content to its natural audience."
"My mom has a cute plaque in her house that proclaims ""Stress is what happens when your gut says 'no' but your mouth says 'yes.'""
As one who longs to please others, I thought I had to do it all. If someone at church asked me to do something, without even thinking I would respond ""sure!"" If one of my friends asked if I was free, as long as that spot on the calender was open regardless of what I had personally planned for that time, I answered ""of course!"" Only thing is that later, I would regret my ""yes."" I would begrudgingly go--mad at myself and resenting the person who asked me. Or even worse yet, sometimes I would call at the last minute and cancel.
In some warped way, I thought telling all people ""yes"" all the time is what I was supposed to do. I was being a ""good girl."" But, really telling people ""yes"" made me angry, stressed, resentful, tired, and at times even unreliable.
In America, full time for college classes is considered 12 hours. My second semester, I took 18 hours, worked part-time, and was a member of at least half a dozen groups, and my door was always open to visitors, and I never said ""no"" to anyone Why? I wanted it all. I wanted to please people and make friends and graduate on time because ""I was perfect.""
Once, at about midnight, I was in the midst of complaining to my roommate that I was stressed and tired and worn out from school work and always helping people. Knock! Knock! Knock! An sweet international student was at our door, ""Amanda, I need help. I can't . . . . by myself. Will you please come?"" As, the words, ""sure I will"" were forming in my mouth, my roommate placed her hand on my shoulder, ""she can't tonight, but I can.""
Why? Why could I not say no?
I had several conversations with a dear college friend, Melissa, who began to share with me her convictions about how God had not designed us to be so busy and stressed. That we were to live more simply and enjoy him and enjoy who he had created us to be. I saw how much peace she had, how she enjoyed doing what she did choose to do, and how effective her impact was on campus. She might not ever have known it, but she was the one who taught me that it was ok to say ""no.""
After that semester, I never took more than 12 hours a semester. I choose my classes carefully, and I only graduated one semester late (and that was because I chose to be a exchange student for a year). I carefully selected to be a part of the one group that matched my talents and gifts. And, I began to feel free to tell people no. Life was worth living again. I wasn't so stressed. I enjoyed my courses. I enjoyed helping people again. There was joy in the service--not guilt and resentment and frustration.
I also had a classmate who was legally blind. He often needed help. He was actually one of the first people I told ""no."" He asked for something that wasn't pressing on a week of a big test. Years later, he told me, ""Amanda, would you like to know why I feel comfortable asking you for help?"" Of course I would. ""Well, you were able to tell me 'no.' If someone, tells me 'no,' I know I can always ask and not ever become a burden to them.""
Now as a tent-making missionary who teaches college students there are many, many things that can fill my time. I have choosen to keep things simple. To invest fully in the things God has created me for rather than the things ""I could do because I have time for them"" or ""I could do because someone asked me to do them."" That doesn't mean the welcome sign on my door is gone and that I am a hermit. It simply means, I no longer feel guilt when I say ""no.""

Taiwanese people do not understand why I don't easily add a few classes for lots of extra money--I am single, have no kids, why not fill every waking moment with money making opportunities while I can?

She reduced her college course load to no more than 12 hours a semester, chose her classes carefully, and graduated only one semester late. She also became selective about the groups she joined, choosing only those that matched her talents and gifts. She started to feel free to say ""no"" to people, which made her life more enjoyable and less stressful. She also became a tent-making missionary, choosing to invest fully in the things God created her for, rather than filling her time with tasks she could do because she had time or because someone asked her to do them."
"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Psalm 34:18
December 1st. I’m amazed! The date on the calendar shows we have just entered the last month of the calendar year. As I listen to conversations all around me I recognize, I’m not the only one who feels this year has raced past as a hare to beat the tortoise.
Regardless here I am on December 1st trying to wrap my brain around the idea of Christmas. I don’t feel at all like celebrating Christmas in a traditional American sense. Our hearts are too broken and our spirit is crushed.
Thankfully, our Father has an answer for this condition. The Lord Himself, He says He is close to those of us who are brokenhearted and crushed in spirit. These few words bring such comfort and draw me back to a time as a baby girl when I would enjoy curling up on a protective lap.
Today I am focusing in on the nearness of God through His Spirit – His indwelling presence. I have to stop and really concentrate on the fact that He is not just hanging around the house with me – though He is Emmanuel, God with us – He lives IN me.
Father, thank You for being near us in our crushed brokenness. Thank You, Jesus, for knowing better than anyone else what that feels like. May I – we – be so tangibly aware of Your presence as we draw near the celebration of Your birth this year – 2017. For Your glory… for Your glory, and for our healing and purification. Amen.

“…He is not just hanging around the house with me – though He is Emmanuel, God with us – He lives IN me.”
Isn’t it strange how we know this, yet we struggle to remember? Reading your sentence here startled me. God is always with me. As you say, in me. He chose me and made His home in me. What a comfort that is.
Thank you, Marie! I appreciate you spending time here with me. Bless you, friend, with the awe and wonder in spirit and in truth of Jesus, our Savior!
I quoted this verse too! It is so comforting to remember that he is with us, especially when we feel broken. I think Emmanuel is probably my favourite name of God!

"Sandbanks Provincial Park
"" The following is an article written by Kevin Stuart about his trip to Sandbanks Provincial Park. To truly appreciate Sandbanks Provincial Park, you need to visit it in person. Have fun! Visit their website (click HERE) for more information.""

The Great Escape
There are few better ways to spend a summer afternoon escaping it all than a day at the beach. For several years now my wife and I have visited the Dunes Beach at Sandbanks Provincial Park and since our son came along, he’s been a part of this annual trek. It was word of mouth that originally piqued our interest and it was the atmosphere it conjures up that has kept us returning. Even the drive to the West Lake on which the beach is located is a leisurely and picturesque on through some of the most historic territory in the whole province, known as the Loyalist Trail.
The Birth of the Dunes...
The current ecology of the area began to take shape more than a century ago when vegetation starting disappearing from the dunes. Trees had been felled and cattle grazing on the area all contributed to the dunes gradually took over everything in their path. By the middle of the 20th century it was decided that trees had to be returned to stem the spreading with the establishment of a forestry station. An intensive planting program was put into effect by the 1950’s where an estimated 3 million trees were planted which finally slowed the spreading of the sand. Today a walk along the Dunes Trail by the day use area provides a reminder of the importance of looking after this unique aspect of nature. It currently has the distinction of being home to the world’s largest freshwater baymouth barrier sand dune system.
To the Beach!
From the Sandbanks Provincial Park's parking area to the actual beach is a relatively short walk and there’s almost always a shady spot to stake your claim for a few hours, courtesy of those trees we mentioned. The shallow water stretches around most of the perimeter allowing space for many individuals and families partaking in their own various water activities. Over the last few years it has changed slightly in that the gradual slope suddenly deepens about 70 feet from the shore but is well marked. It is on the other side that those with watercraft often indulge in their pleasure.
Walking the Dunes...
For our most recent visit the water was quite calm, though other times the waves provide another element of excitement for those who love to play in the water. Of course, many of us like to see the view from the top of the highest dune. It does take a bit of grunting if you’re not in tip-top form but it affords an overall view of the West Lake area. All the same, it’s not something that should be recommended as a regular exercise as the dunes are considered environmentally sensitive.
More To Enjoy...
Other immediate features are a playground area and concession stand on site along with complete change rooms and foot washing so that less of the beach will ride home with you. For those who love the outdoors there are camping facilities to be found. Just remember there are many who have discovered this jewel so book your site early in the season. The park hosts a number of events throughout the year and there are attractions in the nearby towns of Picton, Bloomfield and Wellington. Complete details on park activities are available at the Visitor’s Centre or by calling (613) 393-3319.",What measures were taken to slow the spreading of the sand dunes at Sandbanks Provincial Park in the 1950s?,An intensive planting program was put into effect where an estimated 3 million trees were planted.
"It’s a miracle of life’s incongruities that a single day could be both wonderful and horrific. But that’s the correct description for the last 24 hours.
Four of us — two old fogies and two teenagers — arrived on Nantucket yesterday to find the one toilet in our cottage so plugged up that, not only was it declared user-free, it was potentially going to be that way for a very long time. Since this house has only one loo, having that one out of service left us all wondering if we should just turn around and go home. Which, in July, is much easier said than done. In fact, we were stuck. For at least the night. Peeing in the woods has such primitive charm . . . until you have no alternative but to do just that.
What I learned is this: there’s no better way to take casual relationships, especially those separated by generations, on to an entirely new footing than having to discuss the intimacies of who needs to do what when and how we are going to do it. The teens were predictably uncomfortable but, being well brought up, pretended otherwise. Especially when it was time to go to bed, and it was declared that we would all climb into the car and drive down to the Steamship Authority’s public toilets for a group tinkle. ‘Group’ as in, we all went together, after which we ungrouped to head for our gender designated restrooms.
Is this the stuff memories are made of or what? By the time we got home, we were all laughing about it and figuring out how we were going to handle the morning call of nature. But of course! We would go to breakfast at the Downy Flake, that iconic island diner famous for its cake donuts, not this time for their succulent baked goods but for their clean and available restrooms. Suddenly, talk of leaving the island had vanished and the unspoken but unanimous decision to stick it out was made. The Toilet Dilemma had morphed into our personal bond in under 12 hours.
Today, after the Downy Flake, the kids went to Dionis Beach (where they have toilets and we all partook of the opportunity) while the cottage was invaded first by two plumbers (candidates for sainthood since it is a well known fact that plumbers on Nantucket are more elusive than God himself and yet here they were!) and then by a sewer specialist, the toilet problem having escalated from a simple blockage to a monumental nightmare. They plunged and they reemed; they brought in coils and compressors; they spoke in hushed tones of excavation. It was too worrisome to watch, so we assuaged our sorrows with a sandwich order from Something Natural, picked up the kids and took them out to Cisco for a surfing lesson.
It was, by all accounts, the finest summer day yet on the island this year. Sunny, dry and hot but not hot-hot. Both kids got up on their boards on their very first tries; Cajun played in her first real surf; Pete and I dozed in the shade of our LLBean beach cabana. Life was good. Especially if you didn’t have to pee and you didn’t think too very far into the future of one fragile toilet.
By the time we got home, we had a working john. If only just. And on the porch was a bag left by the sewer guy labeled “Gunk.” I won’t go into details of the contents of that bag, though I will say Pete could not resist, as he put it, getting his hands dirty, to have a look. In fact, he was disappointed. Nothing there. But on my phone, an ominous text from my caretaker: “You have a working toilet. But there are other issues. Call me.”
We are far from out of the woods on this toilet issue. In fact, the woods are the problem itself. What the plumbers extracted was loads and loads of . . . vegetation! . . .a sampling of which they left for us to examine. Roots. And tendrils. Somewhere underground, the pipes are compromised, allowing an invasion of living matter. But this is to-be-continued. For now, there is nothing more to do until the next diagnostics are run.
Never mind. We are just back from the Juice Bar, following a lobster dinner. The four of us, two old fogies and two teens, will never forget this week, in which we bonded over a busted commode.
Good things have grown out of this shared adventure. Even if good things are not growing inside our sewer pipes.
— Belle Songer
What a great memory to share with those two. You’ll all laugh about it the rest of your lives.
Too true. Very special.",What solution did the group find for their toilet problem in the morning?,"They decided to go to breakfast at the Downy Flake, an island diner, not for their food but for their clean and available restrooms."

"Mobile APP versus Mobile Website
Can I not use a mobile app to supplement my website and make my website mobile device friendly?
Computer Age: Then and Now
Let us begin discussing this topic by looking at the history of computing. When computer was first invented its soul was in computation, followed closely by the data processing and information storage eras, supported mainly by hardware. Then the software side exploded, allowing easy access of information using the internet. If one has a desktop or laptop computer, all these information are accessible at the finger tips. The internet is now a living knowledge encyclopedia. It is also the Yellow Pages of the world.
World Globalization: The Beginning of Cellular Communication
On the other hand as the world evolves, globalization forces people to be on the road traveling, into “the move” so to speak. Something needed to happen to keep communication going while people are not in their office. Cellular phones became important to facility people on the move to better communicate with each other, as opposed to sitting in front of a land line all day long.
What followed then is that although communication is no longer a problem with the birth of mobile phones, the availabilities of information is lacking behind because desktops an/or the laptops are left at home/office simply because they are too heavy and cumbersome to be carried around by people on the move. The merging of computer and mobile phones became imminent.
The birth of Smart Phones and something call “Responsive”
The above problem gave birth to smartphones and tablets (iPad for example), better known as mobile devices collectively. But this advanced in hardware once again put shame to the software industry. Now what used to show up on screen of laptop no longer fit the small screens of the mobile devices, making information accessed through the internet difficult to read. To overcome this problem software are quickly developed to include the capability to resize itself according to the size of the device a person is using when accessing the internet, be it a computer or a mobile device. When a software could answer to this requirement, it is referred as being”responsive” to mobile devices.
Mobile Websites
One would thought that the saga ends here once the software industry answered to the problem of responsiveness but it did not. Just like the first rule of economics 101 says, “human needs are never satisfied”, people on the move now demand more than just accessing information through the mobile devices. They want the abilities to quickly place a phone call when the information is obtained, read, and watch videos on the phone, to have the ability to get to the place, to share their feelings through social media like Facebook, Twitter, etc., , etc., These requests are not unreasonable because people on the move are always faced with the “slack time”, defining as the idle time between two activities. For examples, the time waiting to board a plane, the time spent in mass transits, etc. Whether it is the joy of socializing or searching out for information, slack time could be better utilized to optimize the day if the tools are available. Mobile websites would fit this category well because they go beyond just friendly and responsive. They are independent mini websites created to answer to these requirements.
The misconception of Mobile Apps
The wings beneath the wind to support the recent growth of hardware and software industries is a quiet friend known as “WIFI”. Without it, using mobile device to access the internet for information would be costly. Without it, the software industry needs not come up with responsive software, let alone Mobile Website, as majority of people would still use the desktops and laptops to access internet, to play their games, to socialize, to learn, to buy, etc.
But this little quiet friend is not always around. To fill this void (although not mutually exclusive but certainly one of the major reasons) so that mobile people could kill the slack time when the WIFI friend is not around, the software industry sees the opportunity in Mobile Apps, which are small programs one could download to the mobile devices when WIFI is available and use them later. Depending on whether the Mobile Apps are programed using “native” computer/phone languages and their functionalities, WIFI may or may not be needed when the apps are being used. In order to minimize the size of the apps and to answer to the needs of more functionalities, the trend now is to build the apps on both native languages and accessing the server/website when more “power” is needed for computing, processing, functionalities, etc., in which case WIFI is required. Personally, I have seen apps that are just a “browser” in disguise. The browser is native but the content comes directly from the website!
Wait a minute. Are we saying with what Mobile Apps could do, mobile people no longer need Mobile Websites? The answer is obviously “no”. Mobile Apps have their shortfalls:
- They are programs and their functionality need to be programed. The costs depend on the complexities of the program and one could pay through their nose having the program written. Mobile Apps are created based on the Operating System of the mobile device. If one Mobile app were to cover all the mobile device markets, the programs need to be rewritten or published quite a number of times. In comparison, mobile websites only need to setup once and hence they are cheaper
- Because they are programs, they need to downloaded which eats up the storage of the mobile device as opposed to mobile websites whereby users just need to “bookmark” the website
- Mobile Apps have to be downloaded using specific app stores. For examples, Apps Store for Apple devices and Google play for Android based products. Although it is no longer that stringent to have your mobile app approved nowadays, the killer is in the convenience of making your app known. The Apps for Apple Store could not be downloaded, copied, transferred, or forwarded to another device, even if there are of the same made. In the case of a mobile website, one only needs to pass on the “url” or internet address for someone to visit your mobile site
Summary
You are better off building a mobile website for easy access via a mobile phone or device for the following reasons:
- Creating a mobile website is much cheaper compared to building an app
- Mobile websites do not need approval from anyone
- Mobile websites appear in internet searches, and can be used immediately without downloading by your customers
- Mobile websites are outstanding in making yourselves known to new customers as they push customers to take some sort of actions, like checking out where you are or calling you for more information
- Last but certainly not least, mobile websites are URL (web address) based. It is certainly easier to pass someone your URL on business cards, and using QR code, email, and social media, etc.",What are some advantages of mobile websites over mobile apps?,"Some advantages of mobile websites over mobile apps include: they are cheaper to create, they do not require approval from anyone, they appear in internet searches and can be used immediately without downloading, they are effective in attracting new customers as they encourage customers to take actions like checking out where you are or calling you for more information, and they are URL based which makes it easier to share through business cards, QR code, email, and social media."

A warm up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity of exercise to bring the body to a condition in which it is ready to safely respond to nerve signals, allowing for quick and efficient action.
That statement brings me to the most significant point of my Fin Del Verano weekend! The Fin Del Verano being an excellent stage race put on by Paul Hamilton and OVB.
On Sunday morning I woke feeling angry, tired and a little motivated! Elliot, Joe and Myself had ridden a strong TTT early Saturday on a wet and slightly greasy course pulling ourselves into third, only 9 seconds behind the winning OVB team with 11.01. However the afternoon would see a turn in my fortunes. Riding into the last climb of Harby hill in the sprint finish stage there was an incident in the bunch. The less said the better but take it on good authority that I was EXTREMELY angry at crashing out when Joe and I were in a good position and Elliot was up the road.
Saturday was a mix of emotions as you can tell, however it’s Sunday I want to talk about………..
I am a heavy, fairly vascular guy with bones like lead which DOES NOT lend itself to the Harby RR circuit. Four times up a stinging Harby climb and finishing on terrace hill, No. 29 in the top 100 UK climbs. I was late getting ready, still putting my socks on in the commissaires briefing! So I thought to myself,
‘I want to get up the road early maybe take some pressure off Elliot and my warm up has been terrible, I’ll sprint off the flag drop and get the legs turning, if it turns into anything then so be it but at least I would complete my warm up.’
Bear in mind I have never been in a break of more than 6 miles, so don’t judge me for not going into this little dig expecting to stay away for even one ascent of Harby Hill. However the big gear mashing Chris McNaughton of OVB soon came alongside me, alone, uttering the words ‘settle down now a long way to go!’ ‘Hang on pal I wasn’t really going for a full race break’! Two more riders soon jumped across and before you knew it the second lead car was dropping back in between the groups. We were away. In my head this was ridiculous, we would never in a million years stay away for a whole race! It would however take pressure off Elliot and having seen the way he went up Harby on Saturday he would have no problem flying on the wind of the bunch when they decided to catch us late in the race. At least that was what I thought. Before I knew it we had done two ascents of Harby and we were 2 minutes 50 seconds up on the bunch!
‘What the devil is happening, my legs feel good and I’m in a serious break with some strong and motivated looking riders. This is the one!’
The fourth lap soon came around and I was still hanging on, the fourth and final ascent of Harby was a fairly squeaky moment for me, I dragged my lead bones over the top but from then on I’m afraid I was a passenger in the break. I think I did two turns from there to the finish.
Now, I hear you ask and this is the big question, did you make the finish? I can tell you, in what was a fairly proud moment for me in my short cycling career, I did. I came last in the break on terrace hill, fourth from four, but on another finish I would have been right up there. I can now say I have been in a four man break for the entirety of a road race, literally from ‘gun to tape’. Something that I would have never expected with what I thought was my awful endurance ability (I used to get beaten by everyone on long grass runs!).
In both road race stages we had a man up the road at the end, came third in the TTT and some decent hill climb times. Leisure Lakes Bikes racing team just keeps giving this year with the help of our brilliant sponsorship from LeisureLakes, Specialised, Muc Off, SIS and Cannondale. News to all in the East Midlands, we are coming back next year but with two more EMRRL races to go there is a lot more to give this year. Maybe I will get in another two and a half hour break!",What was the result of the narrator's participation in the Fin Del Verano stage race?,"The narrator participated in a four man break for the entirety of a road race, coming last in the break on terrace hill, fourth from four.

"This week I’m studying Mark. Back in the fall of 1981, I was a grad assistant for a lecture course on Mark at Albertus Magnus College, a women’s college at the time. The margins of my old Bible are filled with interesting insights that the professor offered during that course.
I had not thought of Mark, for instance, as a rather “dark” gospel. The story is framed by two declarations of Jesus as the (or a) Son of God, the first verse, and … the regretful declaration of the centurion who watched Jesus die (15:39). If you knew nothing about Jesus, you might ask, What kind of “good news” (1:1) is this?
Furthermore, Jesus’ identity is a matter of some mystery. Very early in the account, the powers that be want to destroy him (3:6), and his own friends and family consistently fail to understand him. Those who are on the “outside” (the demon-possessed, other Gentiles like that Roman soldier) do understand him. Some would like to proclaim Jesus, but he tells them to stay quiet (3:12), reflecting a theme of what scholars have called “the Messianic secret” in Mark (1:25, 34, 44, 3:12, 5:19, 43, 7:36, 8:30, 9:9, 16:7). Nearly from the beginning of the Gospel, Jesus creates misunderstanding and confusion.
At the end, Jesus’ own followers let him down. “And they all forsook him, and fled,” reads 15:50. (During that 1981 class, I wrote in the margin, “Now they understand!” That is, they realized that following Jesus would indeed involve suffering and possibly death, and at this stage they fled such a prospect.) Like the other gospels, Jesus’ women friends and relatives are most loyal to him (15:40). But the gospel ends with them, too, running away in fear (16:8). The somewhat abrupt beginning of Mark is framed with an abrupt ending.
Of course, we know now that the risen Jesus did appear to his followers and friends, male and female, and they gained new faith and courage. But if you just read Mark “cold” for the first time, you might scratch your head at the gospel’s sadness and irony. In her book The Reluctant Parting, Julie Galambush suggests that Mark's community may have been in a crisis situation during the dark times of the revolt against Rome in 67-73 CE.
As I wrote a few posts ago, a favorite book from my college religion courses.
A basic outline of Mark:
The beginning of Jesus’ story, John the Baptist, Jesus’ baptism, and the wilderness temptation (1:1-13). There are no “Christmas stories” here.
Jesus’ ministry in Galilee (1:14-9:50)
Jesus’ miracles of healing
His teaching about the Sabbath, fasting, his true kindred
His parables (chapter 5)
Other miracles like the thousands fed, the walk upon the sea, the healing of the Gentile woman’s daughter, and others
The Transfiguration, and Jesus’ teachings about his death and resurrection
Jesus and his group journey to Jerusalem (10:1-52)
Jesus’ final week (11:1-16:8)
The Palm Sunday entry
The cursed fig tree
The temple incident
Disputes with Sadducees and Pharisees
The Apocalyptic Discourse
The Last Supper and Gethsemane
Jesus’ arrest, trial, execution, death, and resurrection
A later addition to Mark’s gospel, including extra teaching to the disciples by the risen Jesus (16:9-20)
In his Writings of the New Testament, Luke T. Johnson points out that we don’t really know Mark’s identity's community, and the reasons why he wrote (p. 148). While we an figure out that Mark was the major source for Matthew and Luke, we don’t know Mark’s sources (p. 149). My old Harper’s Study Bible suggests the traditional idea that Peter the disciple who informed Mark, and that Mark may have been the young man strangely referred to in 14:50-51.
Johnson (I keep wanting to call him “Luke,” because that’s what all of us students of his call him) notes that Mark has an triadic “architectonic principle”: things appear in threes, like the three seed parables (4:3-32), three sets of public opinion (6:14-15, 8:27-28), three predictions of Jesus’ suffering (8:31, 9:31, 10:33-34), and of course Peter’s three details (14:66-72) (p. 151).
Johnson discusses several aspects of Mark’s structure (pp. 151-153). But one very key turning point is the declaration of Jesus’ identity by Peter (8:27-30), followed by the Transfiguration (9:1-7). At this point in the story, the assurance that Jesus is the Son of God connects with the opening verse, the centurion’s realization, and also Jesus’ own declaration in 14:62 (pp. 152-153).
The original ending of Mark seems to be 16:8, attested to by the earliest manuscripts. The longer ending of 16:9-20 does give us a famous verse about snake-handling.
I like Johnson’s ideas about Mark’s gospel: “Mark’s readers would naturally, as we still do, identify themselves with the disciples. Mark therefore uses that relationship to teach his readers. The message is mainly one of warning against smugness and self-assurance. He seems to be saying ‘If you think you are an insider, you may not, in terms of obedience and service’” (p. 158).
A wonderful, always timely warning and reminder.","What is the ""Messianic secret"" theme in the Gospel of Mark?","The ""Messianic secret"" theme in the Gospel of Mark refers to instances where Jesus tells those who recognize him as the Messiah to stay quiet. This theme reflects the mystery surrounding Jesus' identity and contributes to the misunderstanding and confusion he creates."

"There’s growing interest in a fruit extract from pure garcinia dr oz along with its potential use for appetite control and fat loss. Questions we obtain asked are, “Does it work? How exactly does it work? Simply how much weight will I lose?” I’ll try and answer all of these important questions and a little more.
Garcinia cambogia extract emanates from the fruit rind of your garcinia cambogia tree which grows in southern Asian and is also a detailed relative of your trees that mangosteens originate from. Scientists have found the active component in this particular extract is hydroxycitric acid (HCA).
Study shows simply how much to take
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 90 participants struggling with excess body weight were given either 1,555 mg of garcinia cambogia extract (60% HCA) or even a placebo thrice per day 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner every day for eight weeks. The participants were positioned on a strict diet of 2,000 calories each day from food that was prepared and delivered to them. Additionally, they took part in the 30-minute walking exercise routine five days weekly.
Researchers assessed alterations in weight, bmi (BMI), fat metabolites, serum serotonin levels, appetite and lipid profiles. The typical fat loss was 10.8 pounds within the garcinia group, which was 3 times more than the placebo group (exercise and dieting alone) who lost 3.3 pounds.*
The garcinia group also reduced their intake of food and curbed their appetite by 15%. Their appetite reduction correlated by using a significant rise in serum serotonin levels. It appears to be garcinia may suppress appetite by enhancing serotonin availability, leading to increased satiety.* As a result sense because Serotonin will be the “feel good” brain hormone that can help let you know you’re full.* In case your appetite is reduced, you’ll consume less – plain and straightforward. Remember garcinia cambogia diet reviews will not be an effective option to medication prescribed by doctors. Speak to your physician before use if you are taking any medication [especially anti-depressants including serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)] or have got a disease.
The active component (HCA) in garcinia appears to inhibit the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase. This diverts carbohydrates far from fat storage and towards stored energy as glycogen. Increased glycogen levels are considered to send a signal on the brain how the body is “full,” causing reduced appetite and food intake.* Secondly, as previously mentioned, it appears to stimulate serotonin release which is associated with decreased diet.* In addition, it may help break up the protective perilipin layer surrounding fat cells making it easier for that body to burn fat cells.*
The most effective form to consider
The studies quoted in this post used 60% HCA from garcinia cambogia extract (Super CitriMax brand) that is patented and guaranteed to calcium and potassium to boost uptake. This is basically the ingredient utilized in lots of the reputable brands sold available on the market because of this research.
The dose with the greatest results is apparently about 1,500-1,555 mg taken before three daily meals.* That results in taking two 750-778 mg capsules, 3 times a day. However, a good short term, lower-dose study contributed to decreased calorie intake by 25% and snacking by 40% when only 500 mg was taken thrice every day. But, dexppky89 to the more comprehensive and longer-term study finished with the greater dose, it remains the recommended daily amount.* All doses mentioned derive from utilizing a 60% HCA extract .
With so many diet ingredients to pick from, why take what are the side effects to garcinia cambogia as an alternative to among the many other diet ingredients? Garcinia generally seems to work best with folks who often overeat or have appetite control issues.* You must blend it with a reduced calorie dieting and exercise.
A clinical study on the combination product of garcinia cambogia extract along with other ingredients such as gymnema sylvestre extract and chromium showed slightly better weight loss results than taking garcinia cambogia alone. Therefore, garcinia cambogia extract might be a great ingredient to pair with other diet ingredients.",What is the active component in garcinia cambogia extract and what is its potential effect on weight loss?,"The active component in garcinia cambogia extract is hydroxycitric acid (HCA).

"from History of Union County, Kentucky – Perrin, 1886
Franklin Detraz
This estimable gentleman is a farmer of Shiloah Precinct, is the son of Abram and Naomi (Dunn) Detraz; Abram was born in the Canton of Vo, Switzerland, in 1803. In an early day he came to this country and married in Switzerland County, Indiana. He had several brothers in the war with Napoleon Bonaparte. this remarkable old gentleman finally moved to Trimble County, Kentucky, where he died in 1881, leaving a handsome estate to his wife and children.

Franklin Detraz was born in Switzerland County, Indiana, December 5, 1839, and there received some three years’ training in the common schools of the county. In 1871, three brothers, Albert, David and subject, came to Union County and bought land in Shiloh Precinct. David afterward went back to Trimble and is managing the farm there for his mother.

""Rationally, the regime should calculate that it can deal with any summons of Syrian officials by refusing to turn any suspects over, or, in extreme cases by engineering 'suicides'.""
So, therefore, next point, ""Possible action"" in capitals, and I quote: ""PLAY ON SUNNI FEARS OF IRANIAN INFLUENCE"".
First ball out of the box? Saudi Arabia: .""
And apart from that, discourage other countries to invest in Syria, particularly Foreign Direct Investment: ""DISCOURAGE FDI, ESPECIALLY FROM THE GULF"".
Internally, back in 2006, the USA was already considering using the Kurds as instruments of its anti-Assad policy: ""THE KURDS: The most organized and daring political opposition and civil society groups are among the ethnic minority Kurds, concentrated in Syria's northeast, as well as in communities in Damascus and Aleppo"".
And now the bombshell: ""Extremist elements increasingly use Syria as a base, while the SARG has taken some actions against groups stating links to Al-Qaeda"".
""Possible Actions: ...""

2006. So, what was that about a chemical attack? Is Congress really going to ignore the sheer evil which underlies the foreign policy of the United States of America? Those voting in favour of military action are underlining the claims of those who say that instead of change, the USA needs a revolution.
Is Congress rotten to the core, or does it listen to its Constituents? Tomorrow we shall see.

"First, my helper in this ""photo session"", my little Julia. She had so much fun! she waited until I had finished adjusting or folding the items till I had them just like I wanted them and had grabbed my camera... and then she quickly grabbed it and pulled just as I was snapping the photo! (you should see the ones that didn't make the cut! lol! well, maybe not)
This is the napoliant scarf I was working on for myself, left waiting as I hurried to finish other, more pressing projects. I had a bunch of yarn left and I really love how it looks (it has silver speckles all through it and it looks adorable) so I copied a hat that my mother gave my daughters and made one for myself... cutesy little bow and all! Little girl's fashion is just darling!
This is the ""mossy"" scarf. I was about halfway through it when my mom commented that it looked like moss: the colors, the fuzziness, and since I was knitting some moss stitch rows alternating with the stockinnette stitch, I thought the name was quite apropiate.
And last but not least, the multidirectional scarf. I've ranted time and again how impossible is it to get nice yarn here, and when I saw the Noro scarves in Ravelry I almost bit someone. But then I saw this nice variegated yarn and I knew it was destined to be knit. By me. Into a Multidirectional beautiful scarf. And then... my friend decided to fall in love with it (ok, maybe I'm exagerating, but you should have seen all the admiring and touching and fondling and almost-get-a-room moment she had with this scarf) so I promised myself I would make it a present for her on her birthday... it is comming closer and I am getting separation anxiety, specially since I've not been able to find the exact colorway again!

Thank you for leaving such nice comments on my blog!

Your scarves are beautiful!!!
lol! thank you! I love your blog!
Oh my Gosh, that is quite a birth story!
When your daughter is older, you will have to tell her what you went through.
This is my second pregnancy, but unfortunately my first baby was a stillborn, so this time my husband and I are more than anxious... you can imagine, right?

Wonderful collection of scarves. I love the 'mossy' one! Thanks for visiting my blog too. xx",What is the name given to the scarf that was described as looking like moss?,"The scarf was named the ""mossy"" scarf."
"Because Mormons are Christians, we believe in doing and finding good things in life, and then in sharing those with others. In the Thirteenth Article of Faith, we express a belief in seeking after things which are “lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy.” What does that actually mean?
It follows the old adage that, if something is worth doing, it’s worth doing right! [go away, grammar nerds – it’s a colloquialism for crying out loud]. I heard a wonderful example of this a little while ago.
Our ward doesn’t usually work
assignments at the cannery like so many others do. Just southwest of our stake is the largest welfare orchard the Church runs. I have no idea how many trees are involved. It’s easily tens of thousands of them. We grow peaches, apricots, apples, cherries, almonds, etc., and use them to feed the poor and needy. Our ward has a regular assignment to go, during the season, and volunteer labor. We go out as families, wards, or groups of friends and thin fruit early in the season so that the harvest results in fruit of the
appropriate size. Then we return when the season is right and pick the fruit, pack it in crates, and ship it to LDS canneries who preserve and then distribute it worldwide.
We spend pleasant evenings working together and chatting in the orchard. Kids roam free chasing rabbits and snakes, throwing hard green peaches at each other, or sinking their teeth into ripe fruit which has fallen to the ground (we aren’t allowed to distribute those, so we can glean them).
Anyone can go out there and tour the place or volunteer, not just members of the Church. It’s southeast of Caldwell, Idaho, along Chicken Dinner Road just off Highway 55. Yes, Chicken Dinner Road. Not kidding.
There is a fellow out there, Steve Bair, who is the orchardmaster. OK, so I don’t know his official title. We just call him “Brother Bair.” He does a wonderful job of keeping us all organized, on time, and getting the most out of the harvest that we can.
Brother Bair told me a neat story a little while ago. I asked his permission to share it here:
“I would like to share a story that I was told by my supervisor in Salt Lake. The church just put in a new pasta plant in the Salt lake area. The church makes their own pasta for the welfare system. It takes a special wheat to make pasta. It is done with Durham wheat. Well when the church put in the equipment for the pasta plant they used Italian equipment. Who better to buy pasta equipment from but the Italians. They invented pasta didn’t they? Well to help them get started with the production, the Italian equipment company sent a representative to help them at start up and work out all of the kinks. When they began making pasta the Italian asked where they buy there wheat. He said that it was the best color pasta and best pasta he has experienced. (He has probably experienced a lot of pasta). They couldn’t make pasta like that. Our church people told him that we raised the wheat. It was grown on our own welfare farms. I think some of it in Montana, but they raise it other places also. It doesn’t surprise me that it is the best. It is the Lord’s wheat for the Lord’s table, to feed the poor. I have seen his hand in this work a number of times. I have had neighbors ask me what we are doing that is different than what they are doing, and this has happened more than once. We really haven’t done anything different that I could tell. We are blest. I love this work. It is a scared experience to be a part of and I get to do it every day. I hope you feel the spirit when you come out. Strive for it and you will. Thank you STEVE”

"A Guide to the English Language Bookshops of Paris
Paris has a long history of artistic and literary innovation. It has produced some of the finest writing in the world, from Voltaire to Duras, via Balzac, Hugo and Sartre. It has provided inspiration and a spiritual home for Anglophone writers such as Hemingway, Joyce, Stein and Fitzgerald. Parisians take world literature very seriously, and English language bookshops have always been central to literary life in the City of Lights. So for Anglophone bibliophiles battling their way through Proust in an attempt at cultural immersion, and desperate for a taste of home, there are plenty of options.
The most famous of the lot is, of course, the legendary Shakespeare and Company (37, rue de la Bûcherie). The original shop was founded by Sylvia Beach in 1919 and became a gathering place for Anglophone writers of the 1920s and 30s like Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Stein and Eliot. The present incarnation opened in 1951 on a picturesque little side street just across the river from Notre Dame. Founder George Whitman attempted to recreate the ethos of the original shop, turning it into a Left Bank literary institution and welcoming authors and intellectuals from around the world. Aspiring writers, known as ‘Tumbleweeds,’ still come to stay at the shop, sleeping on beds that turn into benches for customers during the day. The shop hosts free weekly readings from both emerging and widely acclaimed authors like Jeanette Winterson, Carol Ann Duffy, Zadie Smith and Naomi Klein. Make sure to check out the antiquarian bookshop in the next building and the cosy reading room upstairs.
Today, Shakespeare and Company is admittedly a bit of a tourist trap – the books are rather overpriced and the café, although it does do great coffee, doesn’t really offer value for money. However, if you’re looking for a fantastic view of Notre Dame to gaze at while you sip a chai latte and peruse a Beat classic, you’ve come to the right place.
Just around the corner on rue de la Parcheminerie, The Abbey Bookshop is less well known, but certainly worth a visit. A rabbit warren of new and second-hand books just off the main tourist thoroughfares of the Left Bank, it is much quieter and consequently much more pleasant than Shakespeare and Company. It’s the kind of place you could get lost in for hours, tucked away in a corner flicking through books to a soundtrack of soft jazz, especially if the friendly shop owner has just offered you a cup of coffee. The space is extremely cramped, but that’s part of what makes The Abbey Bookshop so charming; books are piled absolutely everywhere – don’t take your enormous unwieldy book-bag in with you! Boxes of cheap paperbacks stacked out front give the impression of a shop spilling over with literary goodies. Handy guides to ‘100 Must-Read Sci-Fi/Historical/etc. Novels’ are placed in the appropriate sections and cute hand-written signs make the confined space easily navigable. It’s the kind of place where you can find anything from the latest bestsellers to beautifully bound vintage poetry anthologies, volumes of ‘An Illustrated History of English Plate,’ to ‘Poise, and How To Attain It,’ children’s books to film theory to current affairs. A really lovely place to spend an afternoon.
Staying on the literary Left Bank, prime Parisian bookshop territory, are two
more ex-pat run shops; San Francisco Books (17, rue Monsieur le Prince) and Berkeley Books (8, rue Casimir Delavigne). Situated on quiet streets in 6th arrondissement, they are the perfect spots to pick up everything from cheap paperbacks to heavy tomes of biography, psychology, economics, poetry and more. San Francisco Books has a classic second-hand bookshop atmosphere; tall shelves with narrow aisles, stacks of paperbacks everywhere and boxes of discounted books out front. Berkeley Books is more spacious, full of classics and some more quirky titles, art history, criticism, literary journals and more.
Moving across the river to the oldest English language bookshop on the continent, Galignani (224, rue de Rivoli) is certainly the poshest entry on this list. It was found
ed in 1801 on the Right Bank, and moved to its current location overlooking the Tuileries Gardens in 1856. Make your way past the intellectually imposing shelves of French language books on art, politics and philosophy to find the English language fiction towards the back. Inviting leather armchairs and quaint sliding ladders give this section a more homely feel. The overall elegance of the shop does translate to the prices – don’t expect books here to come cheap.
And finally, just a few doors down from Galignani, you’ll find the Paris branch of W.H. Smith (248, rue de Rivoli). Slightly classier than most U.K. branches, this is a good place to come for a wide range of English language titles, and also for Marmite, shortbread, Yorkshire tea and any other British delicacies you might find yourself craving. True bibliophiles will, however, find something lacking here; the convenience of alphabetised shelving will never be enough to match the charm of the haphazard second-hand Left Bank shops.",What is the history and significance of the Shakespeare and Company bookshop in Paris?,"The original Shakespeare and Company shop was founded by Sylvia Beach in 1919 and became a gathering place for Anglophone writers of the 1920s and 30s like Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Stein and Eliot.

"Charities ‘AskU’ to turn spare time into cash
Australians can now give generously by donating minutes rather than money, with the launch today of an innovative, new market research app that turns people’s spare time answering questions into spare change for charity programs.
Called AskU, the app was developed by PwC in collaboration with The Australian Charities Fund (ACF).
AskU helps organisations to gain faster, real time market insights at a cost of 20 cents per question. Ten cents from each question answered goes to charity.
PwC CEO Luke Sayers says, “AskU is digital disruption at its best, using mobile technology to create economic and social benefits for both business and charity.”
“Businesses get faster access to insights, reducing the average time of traditional market research from six days to as few as 24 hours. Charities raise funds to help more people in need.”.
ACF CEO Jenny Geddes says, “AskU is an exciting game changer for the charity sector..”
ACF has licensed AskU in Australia and will continue to work with PwC to maintain the technology and build the AskU community of individual and business users.
Mr Sayers says, “It’s a win – win situation. The bigger and more diverse the AskU community, the more people who benefit from the funds raised and the stronger the market research database.”
Opportunity International Australia is the first charity to benefit from the funds raised and has received a $10,000 cheque.
Opportunity International Australia CEO Robert Dunn said, “Funds from AskU will go to its micro-financing program that helps families in poverty start their own small business such as a small farm that provides them with not only a sustainable income but a food source too.”
The next charity AskU will raise funds for is The Smith Family, specifically its Learning for Life program which supports disadvantaged children with their education.
Funds raised by users of AskU support one charity project at a time.
How does AskU work?
AskU is built on the premise of asking and answering questions.
Users will be asked two types of questions:
- Those that organisations pay to ask to gain insights. These questions may be directed to the whole AskU community or a specific target audience. Target audiences will be invited to participate and given a ‘unique’ log in to access the questions.
- A range of general questions that help build the profile of the individual user and the AskU community as a whole. These questions include topics such as entertainment, popular culture, sport, technology, health and leisure.

Frank Sinatra - My Way
A classic, easily recognizable song. If you already know this one, give it a second listen. It's a very touching image of a man who dies happily, after living his life to its fullest. There exist many cover versions of this song, but in my opinion, the original is definitely #1. If you are playing an instrument, like piano or an acoustic guitar, try playing it, for example according to this chords , it's a relatively easy number that's good to know. Have a moment of reflection upon your life with this song :)

John Lee Hooker - Serves Me Right To Suffer
Serves me right to be alone. Today I'll show you a classic blues piece. This number is an example of delta blues, one of the earliest forms of blues music. Unless you are living under a rock, you heard this kind of music at least a couple of times - a short lyric, then a short riff, and so on. John Lee Hooker is indisputably a legend of the genre. He inspired generations of bluesmen. Jimi Hendrix himself was very impressed by Hooker's music. Though he may seem not very popular, he had a huge impact on the image of the music, as his compilation albums still come out. Give this one a chance if you enjoy the blues.

Miles Davis - The Jitterbug Waltz
Original by Thomas ""Fats"" Waller. This jazz masterpiece was covered by many artists, but this one is my personal favorite. Sudden changes in tempo, clever use of different instruments, and very specific mood are what defines this track. When Waller wrote this, he was inspired by his son's piano exercises. It was mainly played on the pipe organ. What added certain depth to it, was Davis' use of many instruments. If you enjoy video games, you might like to know, that Waller's original was used in Bioshock 2.
If you're in a mood for a glass of whiskey, put this on and you won't regret it.

Mountain - Mississippi Queen
A hard rock classic foreshadowing of what's to come in 70s. The opening guitar riff is still easily recognizable. Its rich, ""meaty"" sound, probably inspired by Led Zeppelin was very popular at the time. The song appeared in the recent movie ""The Expendables"" by Sylvester Stallone. Covered by Ozzy Osbourne in 2005 - in my opinion, he managed to retain the original ""spirit"" of the track, but made it slightly different, due to his unusual voice and Jerry Cantrells characteristic guitar playing. I think the original is often overlooked, but remains a leading example of early hard rock. Enjoy.

"India's embattled Satyam Computer Services will get liquidity from the government, but may seek funds from banks and ask for early payments from clients in a bid to salvage the firm, a member of its new board said Monday.
The outsourcer will appoint a new accounting firm within the next 48 hours to work on restating the accounts, Deepak Parekh, senior banker and government appointed board member, said.
The issue of working capital requires immediate attention, said Parekh, who is also chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), a home loan company in India.
The Indian government has promised immediate funds to help Satyam overcome the crisis and safeguard 53,000 jobs. It will also appoint new board members ""soon.""
But the amount of cash required to salvage the company is not yet clear, as the board has the task of sorting out accounts which have been falsified for years.
The working capital crisis may not be acute, according to Parekh. The company has large receivables due and minimal debt. But the board cannot plan salvaging strategies until it is sure the figures for the receivables and debt are correct, he added.
""The board will try to its best to help the company tide over the crisis,"" said Parekh, sitting beside fellow board members Kiran Karnik, former President of NASSCOM and C Achutan, Director at the National Stock Exchange. All three members were appointed to the board of the troubled outsourcing firm by the Indian government, in the wake of a billion dollar accounting fraud by chairman and founder Ramalinga Raju.
Parekh told press that the priority is to restore confidence and then restate accounts that the former chairman Raju admits have been falsified for years.
""No one has faith in the numbers being produced so far,"" Parekh said. ""Unless the accounts are restated, the outlook for Satyam can't be the same.""
""We want authenticated numbers and unless we get that, no bank is willing to give credit lines,"" said Parekh, adding that the board would meet frequently to figure out how to raise funds.
Parekh suggested that the outsourcing firm could offer its ""Triple A-rated clients"" some ""incentives to get them to pay early.""
""It is too early to say if there is enough money to pay salaries, or how we will raise money,"" he said.
Satyam is also looking for a new chief executive and chief financial officer. The board did not confirm Ram Mynampati, interim CEO at Satyam, would stay in the position. Instead, Parekh said, the board is interested in bringing in ""fresh blood"" for the management positions, and that will take some time, Parekh said.
""Few people want to leave a good job and come to a company with uncertainty, but we hope we can find someone in the next few weeks,"" said Parekh.
Another top priority for the board is to retain the prized clients of Satyam. But Parekh downplayed concerns that clients would leave the outsourcing firm.
""A lot of customers have been working with Satyam for quite a while, and would be reluctant to change,"" added Parekh. ""Especially if changing suppliers involves moving mission critical work from one place to another. We've not heard a single customer raising the slightest doubt about staying on Satyam.""
The scandal has rocked customer confidence in India's IT and outsourcing industry, which employs more than two million people.
But Parekh said this case would not undermine investor in India's entire IT economy. ""This one unfortunate, tragic, colossal case, doesn't mean the IT industy as a whole is under a cloud. India is known for its strong, good corporate governance and I don't think that's in doubt,"" he said.
Former auditors Pricewaterhouse Coopers will not be allowed to audit Satyam, but the board members would not comment further on the ongoing investigation at accounting firm.
Asked if PwC would be sued, Parekh said investigations were ongoing and it was premature to comment.",What measures is Satyam Computer Services considering to salvage the firm according to Deepak Parekh?,"Satyam Computer Services is considering getting liquidity from the government, seeking funds from banks, and asking for early payments from clients to salvage the firm. The company also plans to appoint a new accounting firm to work on restating the accounts."
"In my short time on Twitter, I have noticed an incredible range in the digital etiquette of different edtech corporations/organizations. It can become clear quite quickly who really cares about their customers and who does it to see the betterment of society due to their product, and who simply is asleep at the wheel!
The two sites I noticed the big difference between are Flipgrid, a brand new and exciting resource I was introduced to through ECMP355, and WordPress, the blog I have been using semi-faithfully since 2nd year education. I also used WordPress when I was a kid and it was more of a journalism site for reading and writing fiction – so I have a long and rocky history with it!
I love WordPress as a site because of all that it has to offer for blogging, but it goes with its share of frustrations. I had two questions which I thought were fairly simple. I even repeated one once (the first time it was just a tweet of utter frustration).
No replies by WordPress. This is how I felt.
Other people like and retweet which is proof, to me, that these questions are valid to be asked and that, if WordPress answered these questions, they would be helping out more than one person. I also understand I can possibly get the answers through trial and error, reading FAQs on their site, or by Googling for others’ solutions – however, if you are on digital media, why not really be there to help a girl out quickly?
WordPress only tweets every few weeks, and if you look at their Twitter page it has no retweets to their followers’ pages. I think the site needs to hire a full time tweeter to get people more excited about what WordPress has to offer, and answer all of our questions!
Flipgrid, on the other hand, is the coolest organization around when it comes to social media presence. I follow them on Twitter and they are proactively sharing their resource as well as reacting instantaneously to people (customers) with answers or positive comments/likes/retweets. They help their customers get noticed, educated and connected on Twitter in the meantime. I got 25+ likes on one of my tweets and I am sure it is because they retweeted it! Just check out these tweets below. Here, they answer a great question:
They re-tweeted this, and a few other tweets I put out about them.
I even learned something new about Flipgrid while writing this post – people do face-to-face educational chats with other professionals!!! What!!! This could be a way to expand my professional development and PLN. I am using this as an example, showing that they retweet what other Tweeters have to say about them – they are interested in what is being done with their product.
They liked every tweet I made that had their handle in it – even one that didn’t (my blog post):
This is how Flipgrid makes me feel:
So, How Does This Apply As A Teacher?
From this, I reflect that, as an educator, I need to be available in diverse ways to my students. It is no longer acceptable to ONLY have a phone number and an office to meet face-to-face. Even an e-mail is starting to seem lacking. I think teachers should still have their down time (students shouldn’t expect e-mails back until next work day – although the reality is that many teachers will reply back before then out of the kindness of their hearts!) HOWEVER I realize now how it makes a difference, as a student, when you can just ask a simple question through writing (or a short video!) rather than bothering with a phone call or calling a meeting. Becoming connected in more technology won’t mean more of a hassle, it can mean LESS of a hassle (quick answers) for both teacher and student.
I think it is wonderful that students, staff, and parents can now reach me through my blog, Twitter, or e-mail.

"Zacron at The Royal Windsor Horse Show 2011
meets the world of equestrian excellence.
Zacron was delighted to be invited to judge the entrants of the British Drivers
Association of which His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh K.G. K.T.
is The Patron.
The occasion was The Laurent Perrier Meet of the British Driving Association.
More than thirty carriages gathered in The Copper Horse Arena for close inspection,
grooms in attendance, including staff from the Stables of the Royal Mews. The standard
of both the carriages and the horses, including Shetland ponies were the highest in
Great Britain. The Drivers, their passengers and postillion passengers and guards, were
impeccably dressed, some in formal driving attire, others in National Costume.
The occasion was one of supreme elegance, great dignity, even high fashion.
Much credit and thanks must go to stable staff who worked so hard and devotedly
behind the scenes, they contributed to the supremely high standard.
The sun shone brilliantly between the trees, showing the procession at its best.
Impeccable paintwork, shining bridles and halters, the Spanish carriage, adorned heavily
with clusters of bells, combined magic with romance as groomed horses trotted
energetically beside the river. Many horses synchronised their strides perfectly, lifting
their front legs in a coordinated dressage.
The artist was afforded every courtesy as drivers lifted their caps, classical bowlers
and silk top hats giving a sense of timelessness to the event. Seldom has a British Artist
received such acknowledgment and hospitality from a Royal procession.
Zacron was presented to John Peacock the Chief Steward for Driving, also Bob Elliot The
Ring Guard (see above) and was attended by two delightful escorts for the day.
Accompanied by ArtShot international's Celebrity Photographer the party of five then
drove in a state of the art Range Rover to strategic locations around the Royal Park and
Queen's gardens in order to view the Drivers and their equestrian teams in full motion.
The final judging took place in The Castle Arena in front of the Royal Box where Zacron
was engaged in conversation with His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh (above).
Zacron received the cast bronze award and rosette from a member of the Queen's Guard
and presented the rosettes to Paul White who won the much coveted award for the
most elegant carriage, horses and driver at the Royal Horse Show.
Jim Corbett, President of The British Driving Society greeted Zacron in the members
Restaurant overlooking the Castle Arena and commented that he thought the winner an
excellent choice.
Zacron was then invited to attend the Royal Box in the company of Her Majesty The
Queen and His Magesty The Duke of Edinburgh.

"This is a sponsored post for V8 Fusion
Just like every other mother in the Western world in 2014, we do a lot of smoothies around here.
Sometimes it’s because there’s a lot of fruit to use up, sometimes it’s just because it’s easy, sometimes it’s because I can bump up the fussy butts’ nutrition needs with them, and sometimes it’s just because they’re yum.
If we’ve got V8 juice, then sometimes that goes in too for an extra veggie boost – this one is ¼ cup walnuts + 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds + 2 bananas + ½ cup blueberries + 1 cup V8 Breakfast Fusion + ½ avocado + 2 teaspoons coconut oil + ½ cup coconut water. So damn good.
The smalls and I journeyed to Westfield Southland last week to check out one of the V8 Juiceology bars being rolled out. Sprightly young things (called Masterblenders, isn’t that cute?!) talked us through the different flavours of juice available (I stalked the Orange and Mango girl, the kids were partial to “the pink one please, mummy” otherwise known as Apple Berry), and we watched as people stopped to try for themselves. The stands are only for a limited time, so make sure you grab yourself a free sample when you pass one.
Juice fun was interrupted when one kid started crying over a cashew, and the other started when she got stuck in a child ride out of arm’s reach of me comforting the first crying kid. Shoppers were looking around as if to say “where is this child’s mother?”, not seeing me crouched down behind them with the loudest three-year-old on Earth. Suddenly I was that parent – not only did I have a crying kid in a shopping centre echoing off the walls, but I was also neglecting a kid hanging by her elbow out of a bright red spaceship. It was the longest six seconds of my life. Except then I was the mother with two crying kids in the shopping center, outnumbered by tiny red faces and chin dribble.
The promise of a second pink juice and perhaps a trip to the park soon sorted us out and we went back to chatting to the Juiceology folk about the upcoming kiosks. You can expect plenty of Kath and Kim-related jokes if I hit up the one in Fountain Gate.

Is it coming near you? I hope your kids are quieter than mine…
Will have to get my hands on some V8 juice, we have a lot of smoothies too!
such an easy and delicious way of changing up the everyday rotation! I hope you like them.
What a great combo!
It’s pretty delicious! We also pump it up with some flax oil too to ram those omega 3s in 😉
First I have been making a preggers mocktail with the cranberry fusion that is AMAZING! If I do say so myself!
And I have also been making (not with V8) a “cherry ripe” smoothie that involves almonds and dates and coconut and frozen cherries and cacao and some spinach for good measure.
Can you tell it is way too hot up here to cook and so I have been living off of liquids?
Lordy, you’ve GOT to tell me how to make that mocktail! I know how you feel with heat/pregnancy/cooking – I lived on Aldi popsicles pretty much that whole time. Iike frozen Cranberry Fusion mocktails, but not….
We are big V8 fans here – I often pick up the breakfast fusion or the straight veggie juices which are ‘special treat’ drinks in our house. I make an awesome breakfast smoothie with raspberries, banana, baby spinach, coconut water, and flaxseeds {or LSA – what ever I have on hand} that my 18 month old loves.
have you done gazpacho with the Hot & Spicy? SO GOOD. I live on it in summer.
I love them abs I made the chia puddings Stacey they are good xx
Oh nice one, Lisa!
I’ve always made smoothies with milk! I need to change this ASAP I think. And most mums have been that mum with crying kids in a shopping centre. X

"South Asians must stop supporting each other's secessionists
Published 4:00 am, Monday, December 31, 2007
Born amid the mass killings of partition in 1947, Pakistan has never escaped from the cycle of violence, volatility and bloodshed. Benazir Bhutto, 54, is the latest casualty of that murderous cycle.
Pakistan is a volatile, unstable and dangerous place that could spiral into civil war. Pakistani leader Gen. Pervez Musharraf has failed to deliver Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism, in part because success against the jihadists would end his utility to the West. A Dec. 24 New York Times article confirmed that much of the money given to him to fight the Taliban and al Qaeda has been diverted to buy weapons systems for use against India. The starting point for Pakistan's recovery has to be an early exit for Musharraf.
The Pakistani army and Washington need to have a quiet but firm word with him and nudge him into luxurious exile - perhaps somewhere in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia.
The planned Pakistani elections next month were a sham from the start and should be postponed until they can be rescheduled under genuinely free and fair conditions. The rule of law is a precondition for
Yet only the army can provide the crucial stability and underwrite law and order for a transitional period. It is the symbol and protector of national unity and indispensable for the foreseeable future. At the same time, there is no future for Pakistan unless the army stays out of the political arena. Pakistan has a large educated, capable and worldly elite that must form the core of the country's revival and regeneration.
The 9/11 murderers came out of the mountainous caves of Afghanistan where the Taliban regime, a monstrous creation of the U.S.- and Saudi-backed mujahedeen, had been gaining strength and reach. Pakistan, in seeking a military advantage against arch-enemy India, had nurtured them as a potent weapon, and it is the Taliban, and al Qaeda, whom the government accuses of assassinating Bhutto. Musharraf's credibility is totally shot domestically and is one important explanation for the whirlpool of conspiracy theories about the extent to which the government, military and intelligence forces might themselves be complicit in the politically charged assassination.
For years, India had warned that the epicenter of international terrorism had shifted from the Middle East to Southwest Asia. Like the warnings that Pakistan was at the center of nuclear proliferation, these concerns were dismissed as the self-interested rants of the regional hegemon.
India can contribute a lot to rescuing Pakistan from the precipice of a failed state if allowed to - materially and institutionally, as well as by force of example. It may not be able to, owing to domestic political opponents who would exploit any sign of ""aiding the enemy"" or deeply ingrained Pakistani distrust.
All South Asian countries must move away from viewing, nurturing, financing and arming ""the other's"" secessionists and dissidents as allies. In the present state of enmity and distrust, it might be too much to expect active cooperation among the security, law enforcement and border control agencies. But at some stage, even the most reality-challenged and obstinate leaders must recognize that supping with the devils of terrorism has consumed far too many of them already.
Other countries can assist in working toward regional peace both bilaterally and multilaterally through such institutions as the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. If nothing else, progress in Afghanistan is held hostage to events in Pakistan, and Afghanistan remains critical to the security of the international community.
India offers the best and nearest example of Islam being compatible with democracy; Malaysia and Indonesia nearby are good models of ""moderate"" Islam coexisting with democratic practices; and Turkey is the best example of secularism in a Muslim majority country.
For too long, Pakistan has fought the realities of its geography and looked in the rearview mirror for a glimpse of the future. Benazir Bhutto's assassination provides another tragic reminder to South Asians that, although they cannot change their geography, they can escape from the trap of stoking cross-border extremist violence to shape a common destiny and alter the course of world history.",What is suggested as the starting point for Pakistan's recovery from violence and instability?,The starting point for Pakistan's recovery has to be an early exit for Musharraf.
"It’s dusk and the heat of the day is gradually slipping from the air. It’s still hot but it’s much more pleasant then a few hours before. In boredom I decide to make my way down to the hall for an afternoon workout.
1, 2, 3, 4….. I am counting out loud as my body moves up and down. With sweat dripping off my brow I try to concentrate on my form. Is my back straight? Are my hands wide enough apart am I breaking the plane? Then I look over and my little host brother of 8 is down on all fours doing the same and I crack a smile.
Where did this little guy come from? Well I know what his afternoon entertainment will be. After four push ups he discovered it was a little more than he bargained for, but decides to stick around. While I continue with my workout Pati (my brother) suddenly turns into Tarzan. He begins to climb the hall posts and hang from everything in sight screaming war chants. When the sit ups got difficult I chimed in on the chants. We sounded like we wanted to take on the entire village.
I finished up a few sets and moved onto the final part of the workout, pull ups. This is Pati’s favorite part. He always stares, as if he’s wondering if he can do it too. This time though he takes no notice, because he’s taking a stab at doing handstands, which I taught him a few weeks ago.
I am now exhausted. I fall off the beam as I conclude my final pull up. Pati looks at me with a thought on his face. The thought, “Come on, this can’t be it!” I look over and give him a nod which he obliges. Figuring out it really is over he runs off to find some new wonderous shenanigans to fill his spare time.
Small moments and little happenings are the focal point of your service while in the Peace Corps. I often get lost in the thought “what am I accomplishing here? Or Am I making a difference?” When you take a step back and you look at the relationships you build and the moments you share, this is when you can properly answer those questions.

"Welcome to the latest column from Whitchurch’s town mayor, Councillor Tony Neville…
Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for coming to the Christmas lights switch-on event, we hope you had a great time.
Our town council team did a great job in putting on another splendid show, including new lights tree-wrapped in the Bullring and, in addition, new lights on the tree near the bus station and Mill Street. Santa sent some fairies to Whitchurch and has let us know their names and door numbers, but we still don’t know where they are living.
Can you help? If so, please pop along to the Civic Centre and pick up the list of names and see if you can find them all for us, then drop the completed forms off at the Community Hub by Thursday, December 21 with your name and phone number.
The first two completed lists drawn out of a hat will win a prize and we will call you on Friday, December 22 to let you know.
Once again congratulations to the council’s Citizen of the Year, Rose Snell. We enjoyed an afternoon tea prior to switching on the Christmas lights and I look forward to working with Rose throughout her coming Citizen of the Year functions.
Our staff at the Civic Centre have also been busy raising money for Save the Children Fund. On Friday, December 15 they all took part in a sponsored cycle ride, with an exercise bike kindly donated for the occasion from Bodytech.
Everyone looked resplendent in their Christmas jumpers and it was great to see the Friday Market folk get involved too.
Just to let everyone know the last market for 2017 will be on Friday, December 22 in the market hall and outside the Civic Centre. So pop in and pick up your fresh meat and eggs, fruit and veg, bread, Christmas cards and wrapping paper, cakes, jam and pickles as well as Christmas wreaths, poinsettia and presents – why not enjoy a cuppa with your friends while you’re there and be sure to say hello to me.
At the last Makers’ Market, the Whitchurch Town Band played some great Christmas tunes, unfortunately they had to cancel their Christmas show on December 10 due to the snow. But watch out for them at the Civic Centre and Jubilee Park in 2018, I am sure there will be more shows.
Come and join us at the Civic Centre New Year’s Eve Party. The Review are playing, along with The Andy Hall Big Show. Tickets are on sale at the Community Hub in the Civic Centre £15 in advance, or just give us a call, we now take all credit and debit cards to make payments easier.
Come and join us to see out the old and bring in the New Year in style – all with a free glass of fizz to toast at midnight. Over 18s only please.
The New Year’s Day Horse Parade, in association with the British Driving Society (Whitchurch Area), will arrive in the town centre at approximately 1pm on Monday, January 1 2018.
The parade will set off from The Raven at Prees Heath at 12.30pm. The horse carriages and their drivers will be received by myself and fellow Town Councillors outside the Civic Centre at 1pm.
I will be handing out the brasses and rosettes to the riders, including a trophy for the best dressed horse and carriage of the day. Come along and join us for this great New Year tradition.
On behalf of Whitchurch Town Council, I wish you all a very Merry Christmas.

"Costa Verde Hotel, Manuel Antonio
Nested in a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, lies the Costa Verde hotel, a tropical themed resort that’s equal parts relaxing and crazy. While the hotel seems like the standard 4 star affair on the outside, it boasts a unique quirk that no one else can replicate.
What’s so unusual?
Situated 50 feet above the Costa Rican jungles, this decommissioned 727 was previously a part of South African airlines. Instead of the regular row seats, the plane features two bedrooms and a makeshift pub. If that’s not strange enough, the fuselage is also frequented by several monkeys due to its proximity with the adjoining park.
Rooms
The Costa Verde has a total of 70 rooms built on jungle ridges, each with an open balcony that gives a panoramic view of the coastline. All the rooms are air conditioned and equipped with Wi-Fi, mini-bars, kitchen, and TV.
The studio apartment is aimed towards couples and boasts a total living space of 750 square feet. The rooms come with two queen sized beds, private balcony and a pool. These apartments are located in two buildings, both being in close proximity.
If you’re looking for more living space, the penthouse suite might appeal to you. With 900 square feet of space, the room features a panoramic window along with a huge 200 square feet balcony. You can also rent entire guesthouses on the property, but keep in mind that they don’t come with the same hotel facilities that the standard rooms do. However, each bungalow is situated at a considerable distance and comes with its own swimming pool.
The 727 fuselage is furnished with teak paneling from top to bottom, with hand carved furnishings and decorative artwork. Inside the fuselage are two rooms, one with a queen sized beds and the other with two queen sized beds. Amenities include a dining foyer, private entrance, stair case, LED TV and a terrace.
Price Range
While the basic studio apartments start at $70, the fuselage rooms cost around $600 a night. Unfortunately, there are no tours available for guests so you’ll have to cough up the extra dough if you want to explore the fuselage. However, the rates vary a lot depending on the season. So; you might be able to grab a bargain during low traffic seasons such as winter and fall.
Attractions
Besides the 727 fuselage and wildlife visits, the hotel features two cliff side pools equipped with a sundeck. The hotel also features yoga programs and a computer station.
Beyond the hotel, you can choose to take a stroll down Manuel Antonio National Park, which is located just 300 yards away from the resort. The park is famous for the 180 plus species of birds found locally, and also for the rare flora and fauna. The park also contains four beaches that are separated by a natural land bridge: Playita, Espadilla, Tel doro, and Manuel Antonio.",What unique feature does the Costa Verde Hotel in Manuel Antonio have?,"The Costa Verde Hotel has a decommissioned 727 from South African airlines situated 50 feet above the Costa Rican jungles.

"The Senate EMP Caucus takes shape
Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tried to hold a hearing on the international nuclear agreement with Iran, but the discussion wasn’t especially fruitful. It was clear the hearing, such as it was, was pretty far off track when Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) asked Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, “Do you know what EMP is?”
Today, evidently, it was Sen. Ted Cruz’s turn.
CRUZ: Secretary Moniz, I want to turn to a different question. The single greatest threat to the United States if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon is an Electromagnetic Pulse. A nuclear weapon detonated in the atmosphere over the Eastern seaboard could kill tens of millions of Americans. On July 23rd in testimony before Congress,.
The right-wing Texan, apparently competing in some imaginary competition to become America’s Most Obnoxious Politician, said it was “stunning” to him that Moniz doesn’t know what an EMP is.
The Energy Secretary, who also happens to be a nuclear physicist and longtime MIT professor, tried to explain to Cruz, “Of course I know about the issue. I happen to know something about nuclear weapons; I know about EMPs; I know about various….”
Cruz, growing impatient, insisted that an EMP “could kill tens of millions of Americans” and demanded to know whether Moniz considered that possible. The cabinet secretary – who earned a PhD in theoretical physics from Stanford and is considered one of the top nuclear physicists in the country – responded by noting the importance of specifics.
The GOP senator quickly grew agitated and whined about Moniz “refusing to answer the question.”
The point of this nonsense is readily apparent. As Salon’s Simon Maloy explained last week, “The real purpose in … bringing up the Iranian EMP threat is to get people terrified about the nuclear deal with Iran.”
It works like this: Iran enters into an agreement that denies the country a nuclear weapons program; Iranians magically get nuclear weapons anyway; they somehow launch one over U.S. airspace; and the electromagnetic pulse knocks out our power grid, creating a dystopian nightmare and Mad Max-style chaos.
Ted Cruz is obviously worried about this. So is Ron Johnson. Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson have also recently raised the prospect of this dreadful EMP threat.
You, however, shouldn’t be worried at all.
As we talked about after Huckabee’s reference, fears of weapons with electromagnetic pulses are often a very big deal in right-wing circles. WorldNetDaily, the fringe conspiracy-theory website popular with Rand Paul and his followers, has published “dozens of articles over the years warning its readers of an impending attack on the U.S. – possibly by Iran, North Korea, or Cuba – with an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) weapon that could leave ‘9 out of 10 Americans dead.’”
Simon Maloy’s recent piece on this is worth revisiting,:
The “exploded device” Huckabee mentioned is a nuclear weapon that some nefarious actor – Iran, North Korea, al-Qaida, ISIS, [insert other international villain] – has managed to detonate in the atmosphere high above the United States. The nuclear blast.This isn’t what you’d call a “likely” event, but it’s nonetheless on Huckabee’s mind.
As Maloy’s piece added, the point isn’t that the U.S. power grid is invulnerable. On the contrary, its weaknesses have been well documented, and when the White House makes the case for infrastructure improvements, this is routinely part of the pitch congressional Republicans ignore.
But such an attack is “not likely to happen because getting a nuclear weapon into the atmosphere above the United States is an insanely complicated and sophisticated task with a low probability of success.”

"Reductions in investments and low oil prices could curb future supplies, leaving the world to face a new energy shock when the economy picks up, according to a study.. While some of the biggest companies, like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, say they will keep their investments unchanged this year, many other producers are curbing investments because of the crisis..
“Seven consecutive years of rising oil prices — unprecedented in the history of the oil industry — have come crashing down, thus burying the notion that the commodity price cycle was a historical relic,” said the report, a field-by-field study of production trends.
Many experts have voiced even darker concerns in recent months. Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive of French oil company Total, recently said that producers would find it challenging to bolster supplies even to 90 million barrels a day by the middle of the next decade as projects get canceled.
Oil prices have fallen by 63 percent from their peak of $147 a barrel last summer. They are now trading around $54 a barrel after OPEC producers curbed supplies to prevent a price collapse.
But even at this level, many producers warn that oil prices remain too low to sustain increased investments.
Global oil demand is headed for its second consecutive drop this year. Over time, as populations grow, most experts expect oil consumption to rebound as emerging economies become richer. Any slowdown in investments now will translate into higher prices.
This month, oil producers meeting in Vienna also warned of a possible price shock when the demand for oil picks up again in coming years. As many as 35 new projects in nations belonging to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may be delayed by 2013.
“I have often described unsustainably low oil prices as carrying the seeds of future spikes and volatility. In a low-price environment, the trend is often to focus on survival instead of expansion,” Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, said recently. “If we place a low priority on preparing for the future, that lack of action can come back to haunt us through supply shortages and another round of high prices.”
The same concerns are also worrying economic experts from consuming countries, including the International Energy Agency and the International Monetary Fund.

"If you’ve been thinking about doing an animated video production to promote your company, you’ve found an art form with a wide creative palette to express thoughts and ideas. It’s a creative path that many companies prefer to avoid having to hire real actors (or even non-actors) who may not translate ideas well enough on screen. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t hire voice actors in your animation since many professional ones know how to convey dialogue better than actors do who appear on screen.
Animation can basically bring your imagination to life and can help translate an idea about your company that would have been otherwise impossible. Regardless, some companies mix a little bit of live-action with animation to provide something creative. No matter your video plan, you still need to plan it out visually. Even if you decide to go with very basic animation, it’s essential to plan out a story that will grab people’s attention immediately.
The only way to see it before it becomes reality is to create a storyboard. This artistic concept has been around since the earliest days of animation. Many animators who work for feature films still use storyboards so the production staff can get a basic visual sense of how the whole movie will be put together. You might be surprised to know that even live action videos are frequently planned out with storyboards.
How should you convey your animation visuals in your storyboard so your production team understands every scene before production begins? Here at Epic Video Factory, one of our specialties is creating animated videos for companies, and we know how useful storyboards are.
Conveying Visuals in Storyboards
If you’ve ever seen old photographs of storyboards from the great animated studios like Disney, you’ll notice that not all of them look like the finished product. Most of them are just rough sketches to give everyone a good idea of how each pivotal scenes will look. But they’re still drawn well enough so you don’t have anyone confused as to what a particular object or character is.
When creating a storyboard, it’s important to have someone draw well enough where everything in the frame is clearly understood. Also, writing the dialogue under each frame is going to be essential so everyone can see what’s being said for each scene. This text should be very legible in Sharpie ink so everyone on the production team knows every word.
Whether or not you want to use color in your storyboard is a matter of personal preference. It can help considerably if you have a lot of vivid color in your animated video representing your brand. Using branding colors in your video can help your production team get a strong feel for the overall visual style you want.
Let us help you put together a professional animated video promoting your company here at Epic Video Factory. We’ll work closely with you putting together a compelling storyboard first so you’ll know exactly how it’s going to look before the real work starts.
Contact us so we can tell you more about our animated video productions and how our procedure works. With our expert creative team, we can put together a video in any category, including live action for use online or other media outlets.",What is the purpose of a storyboard in animated video production?,The purpose of a storyboard in animated video production is to provide a basic visual sense of how the whole video will be put together.

"NAIROBI, Kenya, April 25- National rugby 7s head coach, Paul Treu, has signalled his intent to lead his side to the Main Cup semifinals for the first time in his tenure when the team wraps up the 2013/14 HSBC World Series season in Glasgow and London.
Treu who has come under intense scrutiny for the team’s limp displays since he took charge in January is under pressure to end the season on a high, making four changes to the side that will depart for Scotland on Monday as he unveiled his troops in Nairobi on Friday.
Seasoned flanker Philip Wamae, center Felix Ayange, winger Michael Wanjala and forward Tony Owuor were included in his 12-man traveling party for Scotland and England.
The four take the places of captain Andrew Amonde who is ruled out for eight weeks with arm injury, Mwamba’s Dan Sikuta who picked a knock in Hong Kong, back Oscar Ouma who is out due to family commitment and Lunch Bar Quins Maxwell Theuri who debuted in the last two legs in Japan and Hong Kong.
The team that is placed ninth on the log with 60 points for the eighth leg in Glasgow that runs on the weekend of May 3 and 4 before traveling to London a week later for the ninth and final leg of 2013/14 season.
“It is going to be a difficult challenge in the last two legs since we will be missing four of our key players. But I call upon the senior players who are experienced to steer the team and ensure we finish the season on a high.
“We are taking one game at a time and we need to get over Wales and Argentina since it will be a challenge to beat Fiji because they have beaten us in the past,” the South African declared when unveiling the squad.
“It will make no sense if we register similar results in Glasgow this time round. I don’t think we will go to this tournament for the sake of it because some of our key players are out of the squad, we want to go there and really do well since the players have a lot of urgency and hunger to perform better,” he continued.
Treu who collected three points to lift the Shield in Hong Kong courtesy of 17-10 win over Portugal is aiming to reach the last four for the first time after managing to sail through five quarter-finals in Gold Coast, Dubai, Port Elizabeth, Tokyo and Hong Kong.
“The criticism we are not performing well is justified since there is always high expectation from our supporters especially after the team finished fifth last season and comparing now where we are lying ninth, its something that we would like to improve on since we want to enter the last two legs with a lot of confidence and hope to progress to the semis or finals since we have won the Bowl and Shield.
“We have seen the impact when we lose key players on injuries and if you take a look at the top four teams like New Zealand, Fiji or South Africa, when they lose players they fail to progress to the next round and for us its even worse because loosing our captain Amonde is a big blow considering he has been inspiring the team so its difficult to replace them but we will pick ourselves up and hope for the best,” he underscored.
“Its like a see saw at the moment because we don’t know what to expect particularly when we are heading to UK tour since for England and Wales they will be at home, so it is not going to be easy but we have done our home work well and have a couple of days to polish and hopefully we will come out of day one qualifying for the Cup quarters,” Treu added.
Kenyan all time leading try scorer Collins Injera, who is currently third on the all time list with 183 will captain the team.
“It was always going to be a challenging season and from the players perspective we took it head on where sometimes it went well and sometimes it dint because of the mistakes we made on the pitch. I think it had to happen since we are on a new system,.
“Going forward we have learnt from our mistakes and heading to the last legs it’s about finishing on a high and building the confidence bearing in mind there is Commonwealth and Olympics qualifiers coming,” the stand-in skipper explained.
Speaking at the same function, Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Mwangi Muthee said, “We will be facing our toughest pool since we are going to meet top class teams but the bigger the challenge the bigger the expectoration and we are asking players and technical bench to make sure they step up and play the best of their rugby since we want to finish the season on a high.
“We have very many youngsters who are knocking the door eager to play in the national 7s team, so after London we will have learnt our mistakes and if there is any correction to be done, it will be done during off-season where we will get a new squad that will go to camp in preparation for 2014/15 season that will be very important since it will be 2016 Olympics qualifiers.”
Kenya is drawn in Pool C for Glasgow 7s where they will take on Wales, Argentina and Tokyo 7s champions Fiji in Glasgow 7s.
Squad: Collins Injera (c), Horace Otieno, Patrice Agunda, Felix Ayange, Billy Odhiambo, Dennis Ombachi, Biko Adema, Philip Wamae, Michael Wanjala, Oscar Ayodi, Tony Owuor, Michael Agevi.",Who replaced the injured captain Andrew Amonde in the Kenyan rugby team?,Collins Injera replaced the injured captain Andrew Amonde in the Kenyan rugby team.

Creating Hope
Hope. This was a theme challenge given to me by my friend Beth for her JDRF silent auction. I so enjoyed working with a theme in mind. (Those who know me well, know that I love themes!) I really stretched my creativity this time and decided to do some mixed media on canvas (above). It was great fun as I first covered the canvas in alcohol inks, then added layers of paper and fabric. I love how it turned out. The other piece I did is more in line with what usually do...a distressed ink look in amber and black. I did add a bit of shimmer to the flowers (a shimmer of hope) but you can't tell from the photos.

Do-overs and Done!
On a good note, I finished this whimsical mirror (above) that I think it would be at home in a country style foyer or a little girl's room. It was relatively easy to complete. After sanding and priming, I painted the frame and hand-painted some wood cutouts from the craft store. Then I glued them on with something called ""Liquid Fusion."" The wood glue that I was using worked well, however it dried an ugly dark yellow (what's with this yellowing stuff?) and if it seeped out, it took away from the finished piece.

Back to normal (whatever that is...)
I made this collage (above) last week and finally framed it with two others. I particularly love this one because I love the ocean, love the color blue and sea glass...see the tiny piece I incorporated?
Today in the mail, I received some really cool inks that I ordered online... I can't wait to use them! But, I'll have to wait...I'm going to be spending my weekend (starting this afternoon) in a smelly gym with all of the county high school wrestlers (including my son). Our high school is hosting this huge event and I'm helping in the coaches' hospitality room when I'm not watching my son wrestle. Not much time to craft, but a lot of time to think up new projects. I'll bring my sketchbook!

Feeling Snow Creative!
Instead of making things to sell, I decided to create some things for my own home. Right now, I have a few projects going on. I framed some photos; I'm making a welcome sign for my hall; and I decided to create some fun light-switch covers.
My sister's friend Allison gave me the idea.
She sells some really cool ones online at her etsy shop.. I'm not exactly sure how she makes hers, but I use a variety of things such as fabric, papers, paint markers and good old fashioned Mod Podge. I went a little crazy.
I'll take some before shots and then show you how I've added some creative touches. (Don't expect much...there's only so much you can do with a closet!)

Be Mine, Valentine
It was a lot of fun experimenting and making these. Give it a try! It's something you can do with your crafty kids, too. I made these with my niece and she made Valentine's for all the girls in her class... ""the boys just wouldn't appreciate it."" Well, I hope my boys appreciate these, but they've grown accustomed to homemade Valentines from mom (including the heart-shaped cookies). I'd love to see some of your creations, so please share them and get busy...Valentine's Day is Sunday!!!!!!

Where are we? Alaska?
Stoli, my Siberian husky, is enjoying it, but she got a little spooked when she sunk into snow above her head! She quickly scrambled out and found solace under a tree where the snow had drifted away.
Well, better get back to that Italian wedding soup (nothing like homemade soup on a day like today!) and probably some crafting or painting.

Creative Outlets
Well, here I sit, back in my humble abode watching the snow fall ... apparently there's 28 inches on the way. Of course, the kids are being dismissed early... I honestly don't think we've had a full week of school for the past month and a half!
Unlike the furniture painting, I really don't plan anything when I start, except maybe the size of my piece. Then I just start placing things randomly until I find a design or color direction that I like. After that, I begin adding texture with jewelry, buttons, pieces of twine, paper and even watch parts. Sometimes I try to glue at least two things in place and see where it takes me; other times I just move things around until I create an eye-pleasing design. Either way, it's very liberating and exciting.
Do you have an artistic outlet? Let me know!

Unexpected Girl's weekend
My sister finally came home with my nephew late yesterday afternoon (he's doing much better) and I cooked up some of my famous Italian wedding soup for her and her family. We are enjoying our time together so much, I even talked my husband into letting me stay up here a bit longer...I've got to offer that morale support! Stacie spent the day making jewelry (check her stuff out at ) and I spent the day crafting! Tonight we're going to watch a movie and relax and tomorrow, I have to go back to the real world. Ryan, by the way, is sleeping a lot.

",What materials does Renee use to create her mixed media canvas?,"Renee first covered the canvas in alcohol inks, then added layers of paper and fabric to create her mixed media canvas."
"Yo-Yo thimble case
you need
a piece of fabric 15"" x 8"" or if you're using scraps 3 pieces of 5"" x 8""
oval shape large Yo-Yo maker by Clover
scarp wadding/batting
a bit of plastic template or plastic ice-cream container!
a piece of ribbon 15"" long or a twisted cord and some embellishment if you wish
Trace oval shape from Yo-Yo template 3 times on to scrap wadding, do the same with plastic template.
Cut out on traced line on plastic template and cut out a bit over 1/4"" from traced line on wadding so that you can't feel the sharp edge of template through the fabric.
Follow steps on Yo-Yo maker's instruction, make 3 oval shape Yo-Yos. I sandwich fabric first then cut out a bit over 1/4"", so you're not cutting too large or too small for the template.
Make sure sewing thread ( I double the sewing thread so it doesn't snap when drawing) is long enough to go all the way round Yo-Yo maker before cutting it. Now stitch in and out all the way round ( I overlap the last stitch). After stitching is done, pop out the fabric and place wadding first then the template on top on wrong side of fabric.
Draw the sewing thread all the way to close up at the center and do a few stitches to secure the Yo-Yo.
Sew 2 Yo-Yos together on long edges, just on one side. Then sew the tassel secure.
Fold the ribbon half and tie a knot on one end. Pull a bead through. (I only do this to secure the ribbon without putting the stitches in ribbon)
And another bead.
After stitching up 3rd Yo-Yo (only on one side) add the ribbon. I leave the small bead inside then stitch up the Yo-Yo so that the ribbon is secured :)
You can embellish any way you like there is no limit. You can make Christmas decorations using fabrics with Christmas prints. You can stitch it all up if you don't want as a trinket case :)

"The other day I came across an interesting tweet in my timeline, RT’d by someone I follow. Although I don’t remember the exact wording, the tweet called on the U.S. government to stop persecuting PFC Bradley Manning, the soldier accused of leaking classified information about our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The word that caught my eye, and I remember it clearly being part of the tweet, was “persecuting.” In my mind, Manning isn’t being persecuted … he’s being prosecuted. Manning violated military regulations — that he was well aware of, I may add — and now he’s being held accountable for his actions. The government didn’t seek him out for punishment based on his views.
I certainly do not agree with what Manning, or NSA leaker Edward Snowden, did in revealing classified information. There were, in both cases, internal means for these individuals to address any concerns they had about ongoing operations or policies. I do acknowledge these internal methods have limitations, and may not have ideally satisfied the misgivings of Manning or Snowden.
I can respect an individual who has the courage of his or her convictions and is willing to act on beliefs despite knowing such actions have consequences. That is how real change often begins: with individuals willing to sacrifice their own liberties for the greater good. By being court-martialed, regardless of the outcome, Manning may do more to further his own views than Snowden, who is on the run and trying to find a way to avoid the consequences of his actions.
It is interesting to note the U.S. House of Representatives defeated a measure to defund the NSA’s phone tapping program, meaning what I suspected all along: many in our government — elected and appointed — are completely in favor of the snooping and do not want to see restrictions on how the “war on terror” is fought. Act shocked and talk about privacy all you want senators, representatives and directors, but at the end of the day you want to know what the NSA is currently digging up.
The fact is, the NSA isn’t doing anything illegal as currently defined by our government; to change the game, you have to first change the rules. If Snowden found the courage to stand up and face the music instead of telling and hiding, a subsequent trial could — perhaps — lead to real change in how the NSA and other government agencies do business. Even if it doesn’t, there is value to having such issues weighed by the courts and not just the media.
But first, Snowden has to stand up and be counted.
I recently re-read Fields of Fire by Senator James Webb, a outstanding novel about the Vietnam War. I greatly admire Webb, who was a highly decorated Marine officer in Vietnam and later Secretary of the Navy when I was a Petty Officer Second Class.
There is an strong scene late in the book in which Will Goodrich, who leaves Harvard out of apathy and ends up in Vietnam as a draftee, is visited by his former roommate Mark, who avoided the draft by fleeing to Canada. Goodrich’s father, a lawyer, calls the police and the roommate is arrested. In this passage, quoted at length, Goodrich and his father discuss what happened:
Goodrich held his buzzing head in both hands. The world had just succeeded in finding the final little nudge that sent it topsy-turvy. “He didn’t do anything really wrong, Dad. I think I have the standing to say that.”
“You were arguing with him when I came in—”
“I don’t want him to tell me about Vietnam. But he isn’t wrong.”
“You know what we’ve lost, William? We’ve lost a sense of responsibility, at least on the individual level. We have too many people like Mark who believe that the government owes them total, undisciplined freedom. If everyone thought that way, there would be no society. We’re so big, so strong now, that people seem to have forgotten that a part of our strength comes from each person surrendering a portion of his individual urges to the common good. And the common good is defined by who wins at the polls, and the policies they make. Like it or lump it.”
…“What about the duty to protest? What Mark was doing is as old as Thoreau. Civil disobedience is as American as—killing Indians!”
His father smiled, just the smallest curving of his mouth. “That answers itself, Son. Thoreau went to jail, not to Canada. That’s civil disobedience. The other is self-interest, cloaked with morality.”
— Webb, James (2008-11-19). Fields of Fire (pp. 442-443). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
“Self-interest, cloaked with morality.” I like that phrase, because to me it sums up a lot of behavior I see these days. I certainly don’t advocate a totalitarian government, but as a group we Americans seem to have forgotten the importance of individual sacrifice for the greater good.
I suspect Manning will be convicted of most if not all charges. The case seems cut-and-dried, and as we always said when I was on active duty: They don’t court-martial the innocent. Still, as an individual Manning stood up for what he believed in and he will pay the cost of that. He was prosecuted, not persecuted.
To me, that’s where a difference between Snowden and Ellsberg is as well. Ellsberg stayed in the US to face the charges, Snowden didn’t.",What is the author's opinion on the actions of PFC Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden?,"The author does not agree with what Manning and Snowden did in revealing classified information. However, the author respects individuals who act on their convictions despite knowing the consequences. The author believes that Manning, by facing court-martial, may do more to further his views than Snowden, who is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions."
"To the millions of people who visit Walt Disney World each year, Disney is the happiest place on earth. It is a place where children are allowed to believe that the world is full of magic and wonder, and a place where adults can rediscover their childhood dreams. Nearly 100 million people visit Walt Disney World every year, and almost 80 percent of those are first-time visitors. But that being said, there are still a large number of individuals who will never have the wonderful opportunity to visit Disney World.
This past year I was given the wonderful opportunity to bring two girls to Disney that would never otherwise have been able to go. They were your average young girls: they liked princesses and fairy tales, they spoke their minds, they loved candy and everything sweet, and they wanted to go on the most thrilling rides we could find. They talked and played and argued like sisters do, but the older one was particularly protective of her younger sister. For the oldest one, this instinct wasn’t just a natural part of being sisters. It actually served a purpose. The oldest girl was used to protecting her younger sister for a number of reasons, but most notably because their home life was not the greatest. The reason the girls had come into my life was not the happiest of reasons. My mother had become their Guardian ad Litem, which means she has been assigned by the court system to look out for them. For whatever reason, the parents of the girls were caught up in legal battles, facing time in prison, drug charges, and a whole host of issues. My mother’s job was simple: look out for the best interests of the children, and make sure they don’t fall through the cracks. So she petitioned the judge for things like new clothes for school and doctor’s visits, she gave her opinion on who the children should live with, and she established a positive and stable relationship with the girls so they would have someone to go to if needed. In their upheaval, my mother became their rock.
As my mother got to know the girls, she knew that they had been forced to grow up much faster than they should have. They were facing very adult issues, and instead of worrying about which color hair clips they should wear, they worried about the next stranger they might have to live with. It’s the kind of stuff no child should have to live with, but it’s a reality for many, many children.
There is only so much my mother can do as a GAL, but if nothing else she wanted to do something to make their lives a little better. She asked if I had any ideas, and I only had one. “Why don’t we go to Disney World?” Being a cast member, I always see Disney as the ultimate get-away from reality. It’s where I run when I have a bad day, and where I want to bring all of my friends when they come to visit. To me, Disney is one of the greatest places on earth, and it has a magical quality that allows you to forget just for a moment that there are troubles outside its borders. In the midst of their turmoil, I wanted to give the girls the opportunity to escape from the harsh realities of life and make memories that they would be able to hang onto forever. Maybe working for Disney has made me a little idealistic. The idea, however, was a complete success. At the beginning of the trip, the girls had no idea what Disney was all about, and all they wanted to know was where the biggest and fastest rides were. By the end of the day, we had engaged in a serious conversation about where Pooh actually lived on Disney property, and how much honey he ate in a given day, and whether or not Aladdin and Jasmine lived in the castle or if they flew home to Agrabah every night. On the way home, they spent the whole two hours talking about all of the wonderful things they had seen and done, and from what I’m told they proceeded to talk about it for the next few months as well. But most importantly, they asked a lot about when they would be able to come back. I told them honestly that I didn’t know, but I hoped they could come back sometime soon.
These girls are not alone in their situation. When my mother recounted the trip to the other Guardian ad Litems, they also asked if there was a way for the children they looked out for to also go to Disney. Unfortunately, as a seasonal cast member, my passes are extremely limited. But that’s when I had an idea. Being a cast member is all about creating magic and instilling happiness, but none of us can do it alone. It is the combined effort of the thousands of cast members which creates the wonderfully magical place we know and love. And so, through a combined effort, perhaps we can create just a little bit more magic. If a few cast members were willing to use one of their Maingates or a few comp tickets to bring children like them to Disney, I know it could make a world of difference. The children would of course have to be accompanied by their Guardian ad Litem, and the date of the trip would have to be arranged through individual communication between the cast member and the Guardian ad Litem. But it could work. And it could just be an awesome experience. In short, the cast member would end up being like a fairy godmother, making a child’s dreams come true. We would be fulfilling our mission as cast members: to quite simply create happiness.
To make it work, the cast member would have to accompany the Guardian ad Litem and children for at least part of the day in the parks, and be willing to act as a sort of tour guide. Cast members have the unique ability of knowing how to navigate Disney like they do their own home. They can tell you which rides are worth the wait and which rides aren’t. They can tell stories about characters and almost effortlessly slip into the themed language which characterizes many of the park areas. They possess the knowledge to tailor the experiences of the park to the particular interests of the family, especially when they are asked a hundred times a day, “What’s the best ride to go on?” Every cast member quickly learns that the “best ride to go on” is not necessarily your particular favorite, but rather the one which your family will all enjoy together, be it the thrilling Rockin’ Rollercoaster or the calming Soarin’ Over California. And so naturally, a cast member would ideally be able to provide the most magical and personal experience by volunteering their time and expertise to this kind of once-in-a-lifetime trip.
If you or a cast member you know would be interested in volunteering to give a child or two the opportunity to spend a day in Disney, then your efforts would be incredibly appreciated. You can contact Meg Devereux at mmbdevereux@gmail.com if you would like to sign up to volunteer, or simply if you would like more information.",What role did the author's mother play in the lives of the two girls mentioned in the context?,"The author's mother was the Guardian ad Litem for the two girls, assigned by the court system to look out for their best interests. She petitioned for their needs, gave opinions on their living arrangements, and established a positive and stable relationship with them."

"I spent most of today consolidating two of my storage sheds into one. It was a long, hot, grueling, tiring and dirty job - not fun at all but it had to be done. I can't keep paying money to store stuff that needs to be sorted through and donated/thrown out.
The trouble with all of this started when I was planning to move with husband #2 and put items in storage in anticipation of that. But then my Mom died and my parent's house was sold. Because my Dad was also very sick, there wasn't time to go through the contents of their house before it sold (we only had two weeks) and I ended up taking boxes of items from their house and just putting it all into storage. But out of sight, out of mind. Everything has continued to sit in a 10 x 20 shed until now when I just can't put off going through my stuff, my parent's stuff and husband #1's stuff any longer. I can't afford it and with the prospect of moving, it has to be eliminated in case I need to store furniture or items that won't fit into an apartment.
Problem #2 - I just don't have much time to go through everything, which is why it has sat for the two years my Mom has been gone. Hopping on over to a storage facility to work on clearing out your parent's old belongings is not up there on the fun parade of things to do. It is depressing and sad to do so. Time consuming and grimy besides. And because the storage site is some miles away, it is another factor preventing much progress on the task.
One of my close girlfriends called me last night having just returned from a trip to her parent's home. She had spent a week there of vacation trying to clean up/clear out the home in preparation of selling it. Her dad is now in an assisted living facility and her mom passed away a few years back. She claimed to have not made much progress in her week there. I laughed as she described how her dad hoarded everything and collected pencils, pens, rubber bands, flashlights, pads of paper and the like. The same with my Dad! In my cleanup of their home, I found a paper bag with probably 500, if not more, book marks! But my parents were not as organized as my friend's parents. There were boxes in my parent's home with papers in them ranging from 1972 - 2002 in no particular order. That made going through things more difficult because I needed to look at all the contents of a box - couldn't just assume it was all from the early disco era!
In talking with my friend, I mentioned that what made me so sad is that the fact that my Dad now lives in an assisted living facility and has no trace of the former life he used to live around him. No need for his extensive pen, pencil and bookmark collection. It is like everything in my parent's home ended up not amounting to very much in the end. My girlfriend understood exactly what I meant - she felt the same way too as she visited her father in his assisted living facility.
In the end, the vast array of stuff we accumulate and surround ourselves with is just junk! Worthless and taking up unnecessary space in the storage sheds or garages of unfortunate relatives left to the task of sorting through all of it. My girlfriend who was divorced in March also has her home on the market to downsize. I commiserated with her that here we are trying to get through the junk in our own lives and also stuck with the task of dealing with the mess of our parents.
These observations have given me the impetus to get through the junk as quickly as possible and to not hold on to much - the bare minimum of memories. It is serving a bit as a guide to how I want to move forward from here - with less clutter and unnecessary items accumulating and stagnating my life.
Today I am grateful:
1. For fireflies.
2. For ladybugs.
3. For butterflies.
4. For cottage cheese with pineapple.
5. For raisin toast.
I know that's a lot of work and I hope it goes quickly for you. I've also been working toward the realization that stuff is just stuff. It's not what's important, and a lot of times it holds you back. I bet you will feel a huge burden lifted off your shoulders once you get it done! Now I hope your post will inspire me enough to go tackle my garage. :)
I keep thinking or the concept that once you get rid of unwanted/unneeded clutter, new and good things will start flowing to you because you've freed up the space (emotionally and physically). A good image to hold on to in the face of clearing out garages!",Why did the author have to consolidate their storage sheds into one?,The author had to consolidate their storage sheds into one because they couldn't afford to keep paying money to store items that needed to be sorted through and donated or thrown out.

"The baby is going to need quite a few things after it’s born. So we thought it was time to go check out some babythings at the store. We weren’t planning on buying anything yet, we were just going to see what was out there…
Of course, that didn’t happen.
When we got to the push chair section, Yasu quickly dragged out this colorful buggy:
One thing you have to know about my husband, orange is his absolute favorite color. I think it all started when he found out it was my national color. He loves this Dutchie and he loves Dutch orange. Did you see his pants and shoes?
Not only was this push chair orange it also stood out in the line of boring, overwhelmingly black buggies and prams, with its bold pattern and bright color. He loved it and I loved it! The quality was great, the look was great, it was a ‘Which Best Buy Choice’, and it was a Cosatto, which happened to be the only brand I had previously shown interest in after seeing other parents with their colorful prams.
The push chair is part of a complete travel system from newborn to toddler. It not only comes with the duo-directional buggy for two-way cruising, but also with this pram:
And a matching car seat. Which the future uncle and aunt of our baby are showcasing here in a different colorway:
After researching 3 in 1 travel systems for babies online, I had expected to have to spend at least £500-£600 on it. So when we found out this system was on sale for £340 (with the option to return for a full refund), we could not believe our luck and quickly jumped on it. Yet when we got to cash register, we got even luckier. Some error in the computer let us have the car seat for free, so we ended up paying only £230.
Only problem was that we had not planned on buying anything. So we came to the store, in a different town, in a 3-door Mini with four people. There was basically no trunk space and there were two very large boxes needing to come home with us. With the help of a store clerk and a lot of pushing, shoving, and squishing we got everything and everyone in. We made it home to Buxton, uncomfortably but safely.
3 thoughts on “First Baby Purchase”
Ohhhh I LOVE this stroller!! I am looking for strollers too and it is sooo hard. I really like the STOKKE Cruisi, but I don’t like the handle. Also STOKKE strollers don’t have much space for groceries underneath and they are super expensive. You also need to buy STOKKE accessoires to fit which are even more expensive. I want a foreign brand because we are both tall and it would be nice if the child could stay in their stroller when we go out for lunch like in the STOKKE. But most of them are so bulky and inconvenient here in small Japan I guess.
Here they all have those old-style looking, cheaply made, four wheel buggies in which they even put newborns, which I think is just not good for their back. But it is even more common to carry them the first few months, because it is easier. So I thought about doing that and skipping the newborn stroller option, but uuuum sometimes it would be still nice to not have to carry the baby I guess….
I really would love to get an AirBuggy but you can only put a MaxiCosi on it for newborns…which they grow out quickly and you cannot change the handle so you face your child, which I also don’t like -.- I am so annoyed by strollers already, I wanna create my own haha
But I really like that COSATTO one, I have never heard of that brand *__*
LikeLiked by 1 person
My friend in the Netherlands has Stokke, it looks pretty, but yeah it’s pricey. Carrying the baby around, yeah I have seen Japanese friends do that, it’s a bit exhausting I’d think. I would at least get a baby carrier so my hand are free and baby is safe and snug. Cosatto is new to me too. It’s an English brand.

"BRIEF HISTORY.
Tumangas and his tribe moved westward to establish an independent settlement in Balikatkaton (present site of Barangay Da-anbanwa) which was then separated from the Ulian River by a lake. Kaputi and his tribe get the eastern side, which was known later as Dueñas. For so many years the place was governed by the natives and they lived in prosperity and contentment.
It was believed one sunny day in the year 1569, that a group of Spaniards who had just occupied and settled in Aklan made it a policy to penetrate the hinterlands to gather foods, wealth and to know places. At about the middle of the 18th century they reached Balikatkaton. The natives fled upon seeing the white men except one who was unaware that was fishing in the lake. A Spaniards soldier approached the man and through a Malay interpreter inquired what the name of the place was. The man believing that he was fishing in the lake by means of the line and hook. The Spaniards thought it was correct answer to his question, but because it was rather long, he shortened it by calling ""LAMBUNAO"", and forthwith the place by this time.

RESOURCE PROFILE
Land Area
It has a land area of 40,709.00 hectares or 246.90 sq. km.,ranks second among the 43 municipalities of the province, endowed with vast resources, cool climate, rich cultural heritage and inhabited by peace loving and progress oriented populace.
Climate
There is only one common distinct climate in this municipality, which is ideal for planting of multiple crops. It has a type ""C"" (moist) rain sufficiency distributed with almost 4 1/2 dry months or first-type climate with two distinct seasons of six months; wet from June to January and four months dry from February to April which favor harvesting of late varieties of rice. Heavy rains, which are in to fall about Mid-May enable, rice farmers to prepare rice beds and plant upland rice.
Its average annual rainfall is 4.511 for 1996 occasionally, a very pronounced drought occurs, like the one which started in November 1994 and lasted up to the month of June 1985, which hamper crop production of Lambunao. The average temperature is 27.90C and the average humidity is 77.8%. This municipality is not within the country's typhoon belt although tropical storms and occasional typhoons pass through this municipality. The worst typhoon to hit Lambunao in this century was on November 13,1990. This suspertyphoon ""Ruping"" brought about destructions, which the residents have never experienced in their whole life. Hoses, public buildings, trees, electric lines and crops were devastated. Thousands were rendered home less.
Cyclones and Tornadoes are also occasional happenings. Earthquakes are rare occurrences. The latest earthquake occurs last June 21, 1990. It has an intensity of 6 in the Richter Scale. Its epicenter was plotted near Kalibo, Aklan. No damage was reported in the municipality.
Mineral Resources
Sand and Gravel are the only mineral resources of the municipality. These are found in the river beds of Ulian and Tacbakan Rivers, which crosses their way towards the adjacent town, or municipality of Dueñas. Sand and Gravel are utilized by this town as a construction material in constructing various projects of the municipality as well as the seventy three (73) barangays comprising the municipality of Lambunao. Sand and Gravel are the most important material needed by the municipality in maintaining barangay roads, as well as in the improvement of buildings and various infrastructure projects.

"As I am currently unable to sleep due to a largish nap at mid-morning, I shall begin my reflections on my first week working at Escuela Maureen Courtney and Colegio del Nino Jesus. The schoolgrounds are lovely, located right where the land starts to descend towards the seashore, with a view of the ocean and a nice breeze. Like all the facilities, the grass is maintained by the students, and mowing is a BYOM (Bring Your Own Machete) affair. It was really adorable to see all these 7-12 year old boys with their big machetes from home swinging away at the grass, frequently cutting down to the root and leaving nothing but a patch of dirt.
We spent most of the week sitting in on classes and talking with the teachers. Because the religion teacher was out, I also got to teach religion classes to 3rd and 5th graders at the last minute on Monday. Fortunately, I had brought my Spanish-language Bible with me that day and was able to pull together passable lessons. Though I felt a little bit useless and aimless, sitting in on classes was very important, because the teachers talked very directly to me at times about what they were doing and the issues their students have. I was at times taken aback by how freely they discussed their students' needs in front of them. After this week, I feel like I have begun to develop relationships with a fair number of teachers and understand their methodologies and the functioning of the school a lot better.
As my integration into the school begins, so does my learning Miskito and Nicaraguan Sign Language. I plan to do a fair amount of work with the ""Nivelacion"" class for students who function are not developmentally delayed but are very behind their grade level, mostly in reading and writing. There are several students in this class who are deaf-mute, and so I have begun to learn how to sign with them. I actually had my first missed communication in sign language just today, when I asked the teacher of the audition classes, who is deaf mute herself, if she was leaving with the woman who teaches the special needs kids. She signed back, ""No, we're just friends."" Like English, spoken and signed Nicaraguan Spanish use the verb ""to leave/to go out"" to mean dating.
Though most of the people here speak Spanish and teachers give class in Spanish, they frequently speak to each other and individual students in Miskito. Still, even those with the most dramatic developmental issues have to be bilingual enough to speak Miskito at home and Spanish in school. Because I miss a substantial part of the dialogue and the culture, I am looking forward to further cultivating my Miskito skills. The teachers at Maureen Courtney have decided that they want us to teach them English every week, and have offered to give us Miskito lessons in exchange.
English is not a recent arrival to the Atlantic Coast. It's been here longer than Spanish, and is the linguistic seat of the Creole culture here. As the pastor of the Creole Moravian Church informed me, it is also fast dying out. Young people go to school in Spanish, make their friendships in that language, and speak English less and less. The Moravian Church is the only remaining English-speaking church in the city. All this is to say that I used to see teaching English as a venture with imperialistic overtones, but I think it's different here. In this region, increasing knowledge of English is actually a mechanism of cultural preservation for the descendants of escaped African slaves. It's a small measure, to be sure, but nonetheless important.
This language stuff is super interesting! I look forward to hearing more about your time at the school, and I am keeping you in my prayers as you begin your work.
Yeah improvised religion classes! (often the best kind.)
Wow! First day observing and you end up teaching! Talk about a gutsy move.
What was your religion lesson about, by the way? I also look forward to learning more! (from Mom on
dad's computer)
Hi-Well, I know you don't know me, so this is seeminly very random. My name is Marah and I was in Puerto Cabezas this past summer for two months working at the Maureen Courtney school. I've been missing the city like crazy so I googles it and I found this blog. I see that you are currently in PC right now, and I couldn't help but commenting. If you have any time, I would love to email you about how things are going at the school and in the city-it really is a wonderful place. my email is mar_bar90@hotmail.com. If you could, please say hi to the teachers at the school for me! If it's not too much to ask(from a complete stranger), I was just wondering what you are there for? Thank you so much and I hope your experience is amazing:)",What languages is the author learning at the school?,The author is learning Miskito and Nicaraguan Sign Language at the school.
"Springpad and Project Management - Parts 2 and 3/
Step One - Create a Project Notebook
Inside your new notebook you will want to create some basics springs to organize your project information. Start with what I like to refer to as, "" the governance spring"". The idea with this spring is to provide the basic project information as well as a place to create all the tags you will need to manage the other springs you will be creating in this notebook. If you look below you will see an example of a governance spring setup with basic project information as well as the tags needed for the project.
At the beginning of the governance note put in the basic details about the project including the project title, project manager, another vital information including major deadlines and deliverable information. The other important section within the governance note is a section listing all of the tags you will be using. Tags are the most important part of organizing Springs for a project. Without a master index, you can lose track of what tags you are using and what relevance they have to the project as a whole. At a minimum you will need three sets of tags:
1. Resources
2. Status
3. Milestones / Phases
Tags - Resources
Using tags to identify what resources have been assigned to the various springs in your notebook makes cross referencing who is doing what much easier later on. We'll talk about how to put those to use in Part 3, but for now, just make a list of all the team members you will have on your project.
Tip: If you have a team that is working on multiple projects, create a notebook for their contact records separate from the project notebook and then just add the contact record to each project notebook they are going to be working in. This way you have only one contact record to maintain information for
Tags - Status
Aside from Tasks, Springpad doesn't really have a way to track the status of Springs in a notebook. By creating Status Tags, you can change the status of a Spring just by changing the tags that are assigned to it. This also gives you the option to filter all the Springs of a particular status for easy reference and modification.
Tip: If you want to have an easy time organizing your statuses, I recommend the following format:
Put the statuses in numerical order as they sequentially progress through to completion. By using this format you will be able to filter and sort based on Status and by order of execution. We'll cover that in Part 3.
Tags - Milestones / Phases
If you are managing a larger engagement, it is often helpful to break it down into various phases so you can focus on the work at hand rather than being overwhelmed by the full project. By creating Phase Tags you can assign Springs to various Phases easily and move springs between phases just by changing the tag assignments.
Now that you have a note with the core structures you need to get your project organized, we can move on to the next part...putting this all to use.
Part Three - Managing the Project
(please note that not all these tips transfer cleanly to mobile so I'm focusing solely on the web for this post.)
Assigning Resources
First, let's get your team members connected to the project. Since you've already created tags for them you're ahead of the curve. Now we just need to make the resource contact information accessible from within the project notebook. If you created a resource notebook as recommended earlier, you can just go into that notebook and use the Bulk Edit feature to select your team and assign them to your new project. If you are not using a master resource notebook you will need to create a contact record for each resource in your project notebook.
Note: Make sure you assign the tag with the resource's name to the resource note. Without that when you filter for everything connected to a resource later you won't have an easy way to get to the complete resource record.
Tracking Tasks and Checklists
There's a big functional difference between tasks and checklists in the Springpad world, so I suggest you decide carefully as to which is appropriate for the work at hand. Tasks can have due dates and each task is it's own Spring. To me, this is good for significant items on a project, especially deliverables. You can track when they are completed, their status (by changing the status tag you created earlier) and assigning them directly to resources.
Checklists are best used in cases when procedures or processes need to be followed but not to a line item level. Something like a review checklist, production process, or communications plan fit well into this structure. Since checklists are Springs you can assign a checklist to a resource and track the status of the whole list through the same process as you do for the other lists.
Filtering and Sorting - Pulling it all together
Being able to see what you need, when you need it is really the key to the entire implementation. Here are my favorite tricks to making this happen:
Springs Assigned to Resources
- Switch to List View Grouped by Type
- Click in the Search box and select the tag for the resource want to filter
Updating Statuses on Springs
- From the View Selection drop down, change to List View and then select Bulk Edit
- Select the items you want to assign a status to and then click on Tag As and select the Status tag you want to assign to the selected items
Changing Status on a Spring
- Repeat the steps listed for Updating Statuses but this time remove the Status Tag that doesn't apply and then add the new tag you want for the updated Status
Organizing your Springs by Status Tag
- Switch to List View Grouped by Type
- In the Filter box enter tag:""Status*""
Tip: If you switch to List View Grouped by Tag rather than by type you will wind up with nice sections of each of your statuses to review. They're mixed in with groups of the other tags, but they're not hard to find.",What are the three sets of tags needed in the governance note for organizing a project in Springpad?,"The three sets of tags needed in the governance note for organizing a project in Springpad are Resources, Status, and Milestones / Phases."
"I love preaching on worship … because I love talking about the glory of God. I mean really, what better subject is there to teach on? Everything centers on the wonder of who God is and what He has done through His Son in redeeming mankind … the greatest display ever of His glory to this fallen planet. As I reflected further on this subject in my own life yesterday I remembered one of my absolute favorite quotes from one of my “hero dead guys” – George Muller, listen:
“But according to my judgment, the most important point to be attended to is this: above all things, see to it that your souls are happy in the Lord! Other things may press upon you; the Lord’s work even, may have urgent claims upon your attention. But I deliberately repeat, it is of supreme and paramount importance that you should seek above all other things to have your souls truly happy in God Himself. Day by day seek to make this the most important business of your life.”
What is being happy in the Lord other than a life of worship. Muller had it figured out and sought after this life with every breath he took. I think it looks something like this:
Not Finding Happiness in Lesser Things
Contrary to some “christian” teaching, I believe that the Gospel is about enjoying the good gifts of God on earth in anticipation of the good gifts of the new earth. Our Father isn’t about giving us stones when we ask for bread. He doesn’t shove a rock at us and tell us to make the best of it. Rather He indeed has given us “all things richly to enjoy” (1 Timothy 6:17). And it is only when we recognize them as good gifts and not little gods that we can actually enjoy them to the glory of God. When we try to suck life out of football and turkey, we ruin a good day. But when we recognize the God of all glory who redeemed us from the futile way of life we formerly walked, then (and only then) can we rightly enjoy parade-watching, warm crescent rolls, and a lazy afternoon of beating your family at cards. Why? Because we’re not trying to find happiness in those lesser things, we’re just enjoying them for what they are – little gifts from the God of glory who is the only truly satisfying Gift!
Anticipation that Fuels Contentment
I don’t live in the “holiday at the sea” that Lewis points us to, but that doesn’t mean that I should “live making mud pies in the slums” either. It’s not an either/or, but a eager anticipation over a dismal acceptance. I know that what God promises me is so much greater than anything this world as it currently is has to offer, and with such confidence I am fueled to live for so much more than mud-pie making. That doesn’t mean I’m forced to a dismal acceptance of the current situation and must coerce contentment upon myself. Nor does it mean I have to keep up a public persona of everything being “good, fine, ok” in the here and now. It actually means I can be happy in the Lord regardless of the current mud without making mud-pies my food of choice … and I can joyfully anticipate the great feast awaiting me on my holiday at the sea. That makes me happy and honest.
Everything as Worship
I think this is what Muller was getting at – When my soul is happy in God and that’s the daily business I attend to, then everything I do comes under this divine joy. I can take out the trash with joy as much as when I study the Bible. I can watch football with my sons with the same delight as I seek to help a struggling marriage in the counseling room. And when the trash stinks, my study is laborious, the game is boring, and the couple’s marriage is disintegrating, my happiness is no less real … because it’s centered on the sure foundation of Jesus, and the not the shifting sand of the stuff of life on planet earth.",What is the most important point to attend to according to George Muller's quote?,The most important point to attend to is to ensure that your souls are happy in the Lord.

The past perfect is mostly used in storytelling to provide background information. A simple, clear main narratives in the past should be based in the simple tense, giving the past perfect the opportunity to provide details of events that happened before the main narrative.
- Jim arrived at the crime scene. He found a man whose head had been cut clean off.
In this example, the main narrative follows Jim, and when he arrived. The head had been cut off before Jim arrived, so the past perfect is appropriate. We could simple describe the body here (He found a headless body, for example), but the past perfect framing of the action brings to mind what happened here – that this was a scene actively created by someone or something.
This use of the past perfect helps put the subject in a situation before revealing past information that sets the scene. It can establish past events, and add details which were not important enough to explain earlier, or it can help put events in order of discovery for the subject (for instance for tension).
- We were talking for hours before I realised we had dated the same circus performer.
- I walked into the shop and immediately ordered the lemon cake. I had already decided that it was a day for lemon.
- Juliet went into the pantry and was devastated to find that someone had devoured all the croissants.
- The children opened the door and searched for a light. They flicked the switch, but nothing happened. Someone had removed the bulb.
As a narrative becomes more complex, and you add style to your English writing, the use of the past perfect becomes rather flexible. For example, you may choose to use the past simple after the past perfect has been used once, rather than repeat it.
- She had been to this area before. It was deserted, that time. There were no people, and certainly no cars. Now, it was vibrant and noisy.
The past simple may also be used instead of the past perfect to represent the subject’s point of view.
- He wondered if buying this house had been a bad idea.
- He wondered if buying the house was a bad idea.
Both of these sentences could be seen as correct, though the past perfect emphasises the idea happened before; the past simple version, however, puts us more in the subject’s point of view, making the bad idea seem much more immediate. This is not a hard rule and requires practice to set the scene correctly, but once you start thinking about it, you’ll find all sorts of ways to adapt the past perfect.",What is the main use of the past perfect in storytelling?,The past perfect is mostly used in storytelling to provide background information and details of events that happened before the main narrative.
"Oct. 18, 2006
Well, I told you so. No one was sent packing from Wednesday’s generously named “results” show. The only casualty, beyond Sara Evans’ departure, was credibility.
I mean, really. It’s bad enough that Tom announces the boot-off couple each week with pauses so pregnant they could spur contractions, but this week’s two shows brought 2 1/2 hours of trumped up waiting and “drama” — at the end of which, as I suspected and as I warned, nothing happened.
Well, Jerry again made the bottom two, this time joined unjustly by Joey. But as we bit our nails into nubs, Tom finally . . . revealed . . . after all the waiting . . . and suspense . . . that . . . no one was leaving.
No shock there, since losing another couple would mean the season would run a show short at the end. When you’re one of TV’s top-rated programs, you just don’t do that.
The good news is that all the votes counted. Viewer and judges votes from this week will be added to viewer and judges votes next week to determine who goes home then. So this week’s competition, at least, wasn’t in vain. Instead, it was half of an aggregate score yet to come.
Will Joey survive Jerry’s dance-challenged fan base? Will Mario make new “friends” off the dance floor? Will Samantha ever master the English language and employ better repartee than “That’s right”?
Yes, there’s still some suspense to be savored. But this week was a yawner.

"Cash's Nursery Tour
Hi loves, its about time I showed you a little tour of this love of mine's nursery. It took me awhile to finish because i wasn't able to start until he was born because we moved when he was 6 weeks old. Having a newborn at home doesn't really spark motivation to be moving around furniture, putting decals on the walls, and hanging picture frames and mobiles... but slowly but surely we were able to complete his room. I have some changes i'd like to make, and probably will continue to shift things around until I have a new babies room to work on, its some weird mom nesting thing (or at least thats what i keep telling myself). His room is definitely the cleanest and cutest, in my opinion.
Lets just start with the decals ^^^ those triangle spicy orange decals are honestly a deal breaker. I knew we needed some the moment I spotted them in The Lovely Wall's shop. They matched perfectly and add so much personality to the room. The best part is they are so easy to put on and take off! Theres no need for painting or wall paper when you have adorable decals that just stick right on and peel right off!!! Theres more where that came from below... But in the mean time go check out the cutest over at The Lovely Wall's decal shop here.
I made these Cash letters using paint and wood letters from Michaels craft store, and used a stencil to make the polka dots and stripes. Easy! I just LOVE DIY crafts! The fabric banner was made for my baby shower and we knew we wanted to use it for his nursery so we had the lovely Vintage Green Limited custom design it to match the colors and pattern of his room.
A lot of you have asked about his chevron rug, its Pottery Barn kids as well as his crib skirt, bumper, sheets, and that cable knit blanket and quilt.
The people at my work are like family to us and threw me a Story book themed baby shower where they gifted Cash with all of their favorite books and a note inside for him to read when he's older. Here are some of our favorites. Im so happy he has a collection, we read every day. This book shelf is also from Pottery Barn. I have it hung on the wall because his infant swing was underneath it, but we've put that away now so we are going to lower it to the floor and hang a collage of 4 pictures above it. I'll show you that in a month or so when we make the changes.
We name our son after Johnny Cash, the famous musician, so we put a touch of music into his room with that DIY rock sign and metal picture. On the right we have Stackable farm animals, the stuffed elephant, the adorable owl mirror, and white glass Owl piggy bank are all from Pottery Barn kids. The picture frames are old frames i repainted in different colors to match his room. The shelf is from Lowe's.
I wish i had gotten a pic of the cute Anywhere Personalized Pottery Barn Chair! Its over there to the left. Its honestly become the cats nap zone, she liked to sleep right up next to the crib when Cash goes down for naps and bed, she's obsessed with him to say the least. The Crib is the Delta Bentley 4-in-1 convertible crib, so we'll be getting a ton of use out of it because it converts from a crib into a toddler bed, day bed, and full size bed!
His mobile is one of my favorite pieces in his room, it sort of goes with that rock vibe, and its Pottery Barn kids. (I'm not only swoon over everything pottery barn, and my house may or may not be 75% pottery barn, but its because we registered there for our baby shower and wedding, so forgive the repetitiveness). His chair is from Amazon, its so cozy and Cash's favorite thing is to climb up on it and stand to touch the mobile or rock back and fourth laughing hysterically. He's the cutest. He also likes to stand on the chair and tug on the curtain (OH BOY!).
The dresser was given to us from a friend and i believe its an antique she painted and it just so happened to match his room perfectly! The 2 little birdies canvas painting was picked up from Hobby Lobby (a Christina SoCal craft store), on top of the shelf is a silver baby rattle, a glass cradle and little white drummer boy & they are all antique vintage pieces we picked up while thrifting on our baby moon so they hold special meaning to us, the Jesus Loves Me print is from my good friend's shop BC PRINTS, they're a must check out online store! The 3 baskets hold his diapers, lotions, creams, brush etc and thats from Pottery Barn as well. The basket to the left on the floor was made by a family friend and holds all of his blankets.
The ""Dream Big Little One"" decal is probably my favorite thing about his room and its custom made by The Lovely Wall to match his room. You guys have to drop over there, Megan makes the raddest decals for any room or theme for your home. I wish I had some decals for our bathroom and bedroom because they're in need of some dressing up.
I SO wish we had our own home so I could do something about this carpet. It doesn't really fit well with his colors but what are you gunna do?! So forgive this clash and just focus on those cute little chevron toy bins. These are Pottery Barn Kids, who would've guessed?
I hope you enjoyed the tour! It was tough to get a picture of the entire room but all that I really left out was the two closets, one holds my husbands clothes since he gave me our closet, nice man he is! And the other holds some of Cash's toys and we store things in there like extra diapers and such.
XO
Not gonna lie I'm obsessed with pottery barn as well! Get both catalogues in the mail and loveeee them!!!!
ME TOOO! LOVE PB!
Do you use a changing table for him?
I have a changing pad and intended on using it but we didnt get a big dresser until he was 11 months lol..so we just changing him on the pad on the floor or on my bed, basically wherever he was feeding or playing. Now that i have a big dresser i could change him on there but he would probably try to roll off at this point lol. ( :
Do you know what the name of the wall paint color is?
It was on the walls when we moved in here, we're in an apartment right now so i honestly have no idea ): sorry i couldnt be of more help! xoxo

"The festive season is nearly upon us, the new year is looming, staff are flagging and looking
forward to a few days off. If you work in retail – not a chance, prepare for the onslaught – Christmas and the January sales. If you work in an office or a manufacturing environment, you might be in luck. Many offices and factories close for at least the three bank holidays, some even close for the three working days between Christmas and New Year. Us, well we are closing for a few extra days as well.
We all need a break and recharging the batteries is absolutely essential to achieving an engaged workforce who are healthy, motivated and highly focused on delivering a fantastic service to clients. In many companies the annual leave (holiday) year runs in line with the annual calendar and therefore for many, this is the last opportunity to take unused holiday time. Many companies operate a ‘use it or lose it’ policy and as long as they have given employees the opportunity to use the time, the onus is on the employee to ensure they ‘claim’ everything they are entitled to.
It is really important that an annual leave policy is clearly documented: that staff know when they can take their holiday, what their entitlement is, how bank holidays are treated and are aware of any ‘black out periods’ when the business is at it’s busiest and holiday can not be taken.
Rules such as the number of staff allowed to be off at any one time and any priority given to parents required to take leave during the school holidays should be communicated so that expectations are managed appropriately.
Good practice dictates that managers ensure leave is spread throughout the year and that staff know what holiday time they have left. They should be encouraged to have used at least half of their leave before the end of Q3 with the rest of their leave planned, authorised and booked appropriately.
Holiday pay can be confusing for some employees and the complexity may occur with part time or term time only staff. It is essential that the contract of employment provides the formula for calculating holiday pay and / or holiday entitlement. All entitlements for part time staff must be pro rated based on the full time entitlements i.e. if the normal working week is 40 hours and an employee works 20 hours, they are a 0.5 full time equivalent (FTE). Therefore the annual leave entitlement is pro rated and if the full time employee has 30 days holiday including bank holidays, the part time employee has 15 days including the public and bank holidays which fall on their normal working days.
Ensure your employees have the opportunity to recharge their batteries – it will be better for your business.
",How should the annual leave policy be communicated to the employees?,"The annual leave policy should be clearly documented and staff should know when they can take their holiday, what their entitlement is, how bank holidays are treated and are aware of any ‘black out periods’. Rules such as the number of staff allowed to be off at any one time and any priority given to parents required to take leave during the school holidays should be communicated so that expectations are managed appropriately."

I loved it, I got to play my favorite sport which was basketball. After my stepdad got out of the Army, the two schools (junior high and my first high school) I went to did not have Special Olympics team so I didn't get to play any sports because of my epilepsy which I missed, I was really sad. But fate had other ideas, when we moved back to my hometown of Waco, Texas for my junior and senior years of high school, Connally High School had a Special Olympic team already in place and I was more than welcome to join...which I did.Played basketball and did Athletics than I later became a coach my senior year for Athletic from 1997 to 2001 (I gradated High School in 1998).Sadly because of my mother got sick, I quit coaching in 2001..but I will never forget it, it made me who I am today. About Me:Born in Waco, Texas in 1979, after a car crash at the age of six month I been struggling with epilepsy every since in one way or another. My biggest fan, my mother Sandra Price-Burkhart died in 2011. Now I'm living in Waco with my baby sister Danielle and work as an cashier for the past 10 years at Brookshire's in Robinson, Texas. I love to read, write stories and poems, hanging out with my family and friends when I had time, also I love studying History.

"Unsurprisingly, this last full week of 2015 was dominated by the Christmas festivities. The best part is that our empty nest fills up again these two weeks of the year. And the fact that our office is closed between Christmas and New Year, and since 6th January is a holiday in Spain, by taking a couple of days off right after the New Year I am able to be on vacation during the entire visit of my son (he is going back to the US on the 6th). This also means that I had a lot of time for cycling and have clocked many additional km and many vertical meters.

The signs of the times. On Sunday the 20th Spain held a general election, and for the first time since democracy was restored in 1978, neither of the two main parties has a majority. Of the new parties in the Spanish parliament, Podemos (“we can”), a left-wing party led by the guy on this poster, is the most important one, having become the third largest political force in Spain:

During one of my cycling outings, on Christmas Day, I re-visited the life-sized nativity scene in Jijona that I also showed here 2 weeks ago. This time it was cloudy, so from a photographic point of view the conditions were better:
54_3
One the Reyes Magos:

Sometimes shops and offices also have nativity scenes. Here is a modest one in a small grocery shop near Elche, where I usually stop for the Coke when I am down that way on the bike:

This is Election Sunday in the small town of San Fulgencio about 45 km south of Alicante. I suspect that a town fiesta was going to be held anyway, so the political element was just an add-on:

The weather was very nice that day, so I ended up cycling 100 km. This is on the home stretch, along the road from Santa Pola to Arenales del Sol. The island of Tabarca is visible in the distance:

And along the same road, someone is using toilet bowls as planters:

Back home. One of my wife’s bridge acquaintances has given her a box of oranges from her garden. Delicious!:

One of the things my daughter does when she comes home from Wales is to re-connect with her friends from high school. One of them is Daniel, a somewhat unconventional young man from Altea, north of Benidorm:

An Alicante vignette. I have walked on Plaza Seneca many times, but only this week did I realise that these concrete triangles are actually entrances to underground bomb shelters built by the republican government during the Spanish Civil War, when Alicante was being pounded from the air by German and Italian bombers:

December 21st was my last working day of the year. The next morning I got up at 4 a.m. and drove the 440 km to Madrid airport to pick up my son who had flown in from Denver via Philadelphia. What joy! Our first order of business was to drive to the centre of Madrid to visit a very special shoe store that Moses wanted to see. First, we needed to restore our caffeine levels:
54_18
Moses is into nice shoes, and apparently one of the nicest are made by a Mallorca company called Meermin. You can buy them online, but they do have one shop in the posh Salamanca neighbourhood of Madrid, so this is where Moses got his main Christmas present:
54_19
While Moses was trying on the fancy shoes, I looked around in the shop. The monitor is showing how the shoes are made:
54_20
Once the shopping was done, we drove home to Alicante, and Moses was reunited with his beloved Cheeta (like many old humans, she has bladder control issues, so we put diapers on her):
54_21
Taco the cat also got some love from my jet-lagged son:
54_22
On the 24th, we went to Mercado Central to buy a few goodies for our Christmas Eve dinner. A new trend is that the stallholders display pictures of themselves, like this lady butcher:
54_23
Here she is, at work:

Poultry on the scale:

Around 6 p.m., I had to go to a local greengrocers to buy some last-minute things, and when I saw the moon was full, I simply had to go down to the beach to take in the view:

Now it is Christmas Eve, we are working in the kitchen, and Cheeta is waiting on the terrace:

And Cheeta did get her share at the end:

Christmas morning–I am walking Cheeta, and the remnants of last night’s festivities are in evidence. In Spain, Christmas Eve is about partying, eating and drinking. The main gift giving happens on January 6th, Three Kings Day:
54_34
We, however, follow the US/UK traditions and exchange gifts today. But first, a proper breakfast:
54_35
As always, Cheeta shows great interest:

Monica and Taco wait for the gift exchange to begin:

The dog was not spared:

Moses is 26 and Monica is 21, but on this day they are just our children:

What would Santa do without Amazon?

Golf skirt for my wife, to go with the Garmin golf watch and the personalised golf balls:
54_43
And finally, the official Christmas Day family portrait:
I appreciate your sharing of your wonderful family events. I wish mine were worthy of that!
The turkey looks much larger than the one you had about a month ago. You are coping very well with Cheeta’s infirmity.
I wonder about the colours of this set. Allowing for the fact that many are interior shots, many colors seem desaturated. has something changed? or is it just my eyes in the very early morning (1:33 am)? Brian
Comment by Brian — 29 December 2015 @ 13:33",What is the main gift-giving day in Spain?,"The main gift giving happens on January 6th, Three Kings Day in Spain."
"The epic flood in Texas has left thousands homeless and distraught. Around twenty fatalities are confirmed thus far. The number will rise. Our media have given over hours and hours to this catastrophe. In fact, conscientious journalists have been so very busy in Texas, they've not been able to attend to the Monsoon deluges across India, Bangladesh and Nepal where over 1,200 people have died. Or to Myanmar where violence has erupted setting off mass migrations.
This manmade cataclysm is causing untold grief and distress. The victims are beleaguered, despised, savagely discriminated against, described by many international aid organisations as the 'among the most persecuted people in the world'. They have been in what was Burma for three generations, but have no rights, no citizenship, no protection under the law.
Should we be asking questions like 'Are Rohingya Muslims On The Path To Extinction?'
Don't ever believe that Buddhists are all calm and humane, their monks, ethereal ascetics in orange. In Myanmar, the serene Buddha's extremist followers have been maltreating and intimidating the Rohingya minority forever. The army turns mortars and machine guns on these defenceless, stateless folk. Their villages are burnt.
India is about to expel the thousands who have fled there. The only place of safety is Bangladesh, a country with few recourses where almost 18,000 have fled to in the last five days. Kofi Anan, the erstwhile UN secretary has warned that the status quo cannot continue. The latest purge came after Rohingya insurgents attacked thirty police stations last Friday, killing 11 people. The state response was swift. The rebels were despatched.
But it didn't end there. Civilians are being collectively punished for the insurgency. On that same Friday, Annan published a report commissioned by the Myanmar government which recommended equal citizenship rights for Muslims. Since then UN officials have been blanked by the political elite and hostility is being whipped up against reputable, neutral aid agencies.
This story has another shocking dimension. Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel peace laureate, is the elected leader of Myanmar today. She has not only failed to protect the Rohingya minority from injustices, she now damns them all. To her every one of them, woman, child, baby, man, is an 'Islamicist terrorist'. Food can no longer be delivered to the starving.
Tins of UN world food biscuits were found near the places where the recent uprisings took place, so the steely leader accuses aid agencies of treachery and supporting the enemies of her nation.' (This is a favourite Taliban ploy. The lady is all for learning from the worst of humans). Over a dozen Nobel Laureates have publicly condemned Aung San Suu Kyi for colluding with ethnic and religious cleansing.
How did this happen? She was (or seemed to be) a democrat and human rights defender. She spent fifteen years under house arrest when the country was under military rule, was adored by everyone from Popes to Presidents, Princes to pop stars. She wore flowers in her hair. She was honoured by universities, the BBC, Time Magazine. She is Bono's hero, Obama's inspiration, the Dalai Lama's idol. Was mine too.
We were neighbours in Oxford. She lived in Parktown, so did I just a few doors away. We spoke sometimes and once were at a dinner when she criticised the North Vietnamese for their 'cruelties'. She was poised, beautiful, electrifying. Her husband, Dr Michael Aris was a quiet, gentle academic. When he was dying of cancer, she decided to stay in Burma for political reasons. That was when I changed my mind about her. Love was sacrificed for power. Or so it seemed.
Now she has the position she long craved, she turns viciously authoritarian. Freedom of speech is curtailed, so too democratic entitlements.
Westerners still find her irresistible, exotic, an embodiment of eastern stoicism. Besides, like Mandela, she is an an affirmation of their noble commitment to third world development. She makes them feel good.
Besides, the people she is going after are Muslims. Who cares about them? When Islamicist fanatics victimise and terrorise western civilians, there is global outrage. I understand why. What I can't accept is the general indifference that prevails when Muslims are victimised and terrorised by non-Muslim leaders, governments, militias, the military and the hard right.
Since 9/11, we have sunk appallingly low in the league of humans whose lives have value. Moral confusion plays its part too. Most Muslims are killed or maimed by fellow believers in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere. After every terrorist attack, even good, white British friends of mine have less sympathy to spare for blameless Muslims.
So Aung San Suu Kyi is well covered. She will not be stopped. And unlike the similarly threatened Bosnian Muslims in 1994, western allies will not intervene to save Rohingya Muslims. All we can do is weep for them. And call out the fragrant saint who turned into a brutal sinner.
Yasmin Alibhai-Brown is a journalist, columnist, broadcaster and author.",Who is the elected leader of Myanmar and what is her stance on the Rohingya minority?,"The elected leader of Myanmar is Aung San Suu Kyi. She has not only failed to protect the Rohingya minority from injustices, but she also labels them all as 'Islamicist terrorists'."

When asked what they attribute their popularity to, leader Jaebeom answered, “We have no typical style like other idol groups, and I think we appeal to fans by not worrying about our individual images and just playing, talking, and dancing as we feel like it on stage. It seems like our fans call us ‘animal idols’ because of our barbaric personalities.”
Fellow member Junsu replied, “I think there are a lot of fans who like us for directly saying things and just saying everything we want to say on shows.” Thailand-American member Nichkhun added, “I feel like that’s why the fans think we’re sexier.”
And sexy they most certainly are. Out of the celebrity comments, I definitely relate to Chaeyeon’s comment the most. Oh, 2PM…you make our hearts sh-sh-shake.

"By purest coincidence, I was looking through a magazine rack at CVS yesterday and taking notice of how well Oprah Winfrey has been keeping the pounds off lately. Then, this morning, I saw footage of her walking across a stage to announce her latest venture, something to do with chai tea. Mama mia! The woman I saw smiling and waving, presumably the real Oprah, was easily 50 pounds heavier than the look-alike who has been gracing the cover of recent O’s, though I will say, as mitigation, that the strategically shot March cover has a graphic over OW’s gut.
I could not care less how much Oprah weighs or what she looks like. However, an ethical narcissistic—and what else can you call a woman who publishes a magazine named after herself that has her as the cover model for every single issue?—has limited choices:
- Keep yourself in fabulous shape, so you are fit to be a cover girl (by your own standards)
- Don’t put yourself on the cover when you don’t feel cover-worthy
- Use cartoons, or
- Let it all hang out.
Not an ethical option: showing your loyal, trusting readers that you look one way, when in fact you look a whole lot fatter.
Yes, yes, I know—photoshopping, airbrushing, make-up, glamor photos, “it’s done all the time.” This is Oprah’s magazine, her image and her body, and pictures communicate. Her covers say “This is what I look like, be like me.” If she doesn’t look like her covers or even close, that’s an outright, calculated lie. It’s really as simple as that.
10 responses to “Who’s That Woman On The Cover of “O” Magazine?”
Those covers are shot easily six months or more in advance. For all we know, she could have gained weight between then and now. She fluctuates quite often.
But with all that said, where do you draw the unethical line? Surely you can’t expect her to be photographed right out of bed, all gross and bleary-eyed? Is it just the PhotoShop, or would spanx, makeup, and hair combs cross the unethical line as well.
Six months? Uh-uh. I’ve participated in magazine shoots. Yes, they are shot in advance. Not six months, or at least they don’t have to be.
Where would YOU draw the line? Showing herself as a body builder? 20 years old? 6-feet tall? White? A man? I place a higher standard on her because the whole magazine is self-advertizing. Now it’s false advertizing. If she doesn’t look like this months cover, which implicitly represents its image as this months Oprah (whenever the photo was taken), then she can find another shot.
Surely you can see the stark difference between photo editing an image and the mechanical / physical means of adding make up or wearing spanx?
I do know that taking the principle of “altering appearance” to the extreme and ignoring all other values, then you can get away with saying make up is fake up and spanx are a lie. However, personal grooming, reasonable pride, et al, are other values to consider.
So no, the physical things you do to alter your appearance in the here and now, within reason, are not deception. The things you do to alter a permanent image of you that capture what we *reasonably* assume is reality, is deceptive.
Are there special ethics for narcissists? I would think by definition a narcissist is unethical.
Depends on how it expresses itself. I don’t think you could have an effective politician or lawyer who wasn’t narcissistic to a pretty significant degree.
What I find really sad about this – Oprah is one of the most successful women in the business. And she got there despite the extra pounds. By now, she must have realized that people like her anyway… Why she then feels the need to airbrush her cover picture to the extreme I do not understand.
Oprah is more photoshopped than a Burger King menu picture! She has never been married and has no children. She has given rise to Oz and McGraw who have had their share of controversy for being less than forthright. Her gaggle of devotees are as predictable as her next “O Cover”
I lost interest in her and what she has to say years ago.
Oprah preaches that women should be their authentic selves…why doesn’t she practice what she preaches with these month after month fake covers of herself. Makes her appear so insecure! Who can take her seriously, really?
She is a fake from the word go….
Can ‘t wait for my subscription to expire……
Honestly I was appalled by her magazine by its 2nd issue when I counted up the cost of the outfit she wore for the cover and saw the ads inside the magazine all catering to a higher economic group than most, her average viewer could afford. I really felt disconnected to those values in the magazine compared to the Oprah I first came to admire. Her last cover literally has photo-shopped her 30 years younger, wow, but the magazine is right by the cash register so the numbers of sales therefore are making a point, kinda disheartening.",What are the criticisms raised against Oprah Winfrey regarding her magazine covers?,"The criticisms raised against Oprah Winfrey regarding her magazine covers include her appearing significantly slimmer and younger than her real self, which is seen as deceptive and not authentic. It is argued that she is not practicing what she preaches about women being their authentic selves. The magazine is also criticized for catering to a higher economic group than most of her average viewers can afford."
"Libdrone's Thoughts and Musings
Today’s words have me envisioning a rather large bowl with stripes of different jams– strawberry and cherry and apple and orange marmalade and plum and peach, swirling rainbow like. Yet I can’t help but think that a few good strokes with a spoon could turn that rainbow into a truly mixed mess that might taste just awful.
I’m find it difficult to focus on today’s words, as #definethis today has me raising a hue and cry, though only because I mistook hew for hue. For such short words these two have a number of meanings and seemingly endless potential for mis-understanding. While in modern usage a hue is a shade of color, it turns out that the old expression is ‘hue and cry’ (rather than ‘hew and cry’). I was not able to determine to my satisfaction how the word for a tone of color…

"I am a survivor.
It didn’t actually kill me.
It was touch and go there for a while, but I persevered and came out alive!
No, I’m not talking about climbing Everest, finishing an Ironman, or earning a Ph.D. I’m talking about living with a 17-year-old male. Simply living. Not thriving because heck, he should just be grateful HE is still alive at this point.
My second son turned 18 a few months ago and all I can think is, “Sayonara age 17! You can’t be gone fast enough!”
It seems every parent of a teenager has that ONE year that tests their patience, spirit, will, and sanity more than other years. With my first it was age 15, but with my second it was 17. You’d think by age 17 you’d see maybe just a little more frontal lobe development in their brains, and the immature nonsensical behavior and attitude would be by the wayside, but that’s not always the case. Just like you can have an adolescent who is a late bloomer physically, so can you have one that mentally and emotionally takes their time maturing. Lots and lots of TIME.
And also, HE IS 17. It’s because he is a 17-year-old boy!
Throughout the tumultuous and exhausting year 17, I had to keep reminding myself of that simple and glaring fact, and repeatedly self-talking in my head, “It’s because he is 17.”
Why doesn’t he notice things? Little things like when his little brother has had enough of his teasing, or big things like when his mom is sending out signals that she is gravely upset and needs to be taken seriously. Why doesn’t he notice? It’s because he’s 17.
Why can he not remember something I’ve told him 85 times, but can remember every lyric to 50 rap songs, and the score of a basketball game from 6 months ago? It’s because he’s 17.
He doesn’t realize how fast he drives sometimes. He thinks everyone else on the road is a smart and safe driver and will never cause him to be in an accident, and loud music on in the car isn’t distracting him. He thinks like this because he’s 17.
In his mind, his only future is tomorrow. It’s not next week, next month, next semester, or next school year. There is no long-term thinking about “his future” at this point, and that’s because he is 17.
He shouldn’t be dating your daughter, or dating at all really. He doesn’t have a high enough relationship I.Q. to even remember (and appreciate and desire) to hug his own mother, so he is not capable of giving your daughter the attention she craves and deserves. It’s not because he’s not a “good guy,” it’s because he’s thinking about his next pizza, not emotionally supporting another human. Why? Becausee he is 17.
Alarm clocks are ignored. Cars are returned with empty gas tanks. Bedrooms are filled with empty cups, plates, and soda cans. Bathrooms are unrecognizable, and clean laundry means it passed the sniff test. It’s all behavior that screams, “He is 17!”
And then something magical happens. It’s that same age progression magic that years before turned your tantrum-filled two-year old into an agreeable and bright three-year old who you actually enjoyed being around. That 17-year-old the one tethering on insanity and bringing you to your knees every night – wakes up one day and is 18. The 17-year-old excuse no longer holds water, and it doesn’t need to, because 18 brings with it not just a voter ID card and the chance to buy lottery tickets, but a very poised adult whom you can’t welcome back into your life fast enough.
He is 18! He hugs, smiles, and helps make dinner. He takes care of younger siblings without complaint and payment. He passes college entrance exams with flying colors, and talks about a future that includes career choices, not just pizza toppings. He saves money, cleans his room regularly and without prompting, and talks about moving out and going to college with excitement, not nervousness.
And he eagerly hugs you, without pulling away first or acting like he’s too “old” for that. He does all those things because he’s 18. Because he is 18! He is knocking on adulthood’s door polished, and with the confidence and conviction that only time and experience can bring. He is all these things because he is 18.
Now just think what 19 will look like.

"I love walking! There are just so darn many good reasons to put on your runners and head out the door!
Let’s start with the fact that it is an exercise that you don’t have to practice to get your form right! Most of us have been doing it quite successfully for years! It is available to just about everyone, free of any costs! And, for the most part, it is safe! You don’t even need a spotter!
Some of the benefits to walking a good brisk walk are as simple as keeping you mobile, because the longer we stay stationary or sedentary the longer we will likely stay stationary or sedentary!! And that’s when a heap of other problems can start to creep up on you.
Walking can lower blood pressure! Walking can help you to maintain your weight, or even to lose a few pounds! Walking has been known to help lower the bad cholesterol and raise the good cholesterol! Walking briskly, as a routine, can help you elevate your mood and keep you strong and fit!
Whether you choose to go on a solitary walk to clear your head of the day’s thoughts and issues, or find a companion and make it a social event, walking is a great way to get healthy and stay healthy. If you are walking alone, make sure to let somebody know when you are going and where you will be walking.
Before you start your walk, make sure you are wearing comfortable shoes that have good support and a cushion type sole. Dress yourself in clothes that are also comfortable, brightly coloured and weather appropriate.
When you start out, walk slowly at first to warm up those muscles and then do a few stretches, especially your calf muscles and hamstrings! Now you are ready to really get going into a nice brisk pace. If you are just getting out there, after being inactive for a while, just take it easy, and increase your speed and time a little every day. I made a resolution to get moving this year and was gifted a pedometer, which is a really fun way to measure your progress.
Walking your way to good health, both physical and mental, is a great gift to yourself, one you can afford to do every day! Why not give it a try? It could be the best thing you ever do for yourself!
",What are some benefits of walking regularly?,"Some of the benefits of walking regularly include keeping you mobile, lowering blood pressure, helping to maintain or lose weight, lowering bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol, and elevating your mood. It can also keep you strong and fit."

"The mobile homes we produce are developed on a steel frame equipped with axles and wheels. They are fully produced by us inside the factory – along with the roof and equipment. The buildings are moved to their destination on a car transporter or a low-loader semi-trailer depending on the structure's size. Assembly works are limited to setting up the house in the previously chosen and prepared area and connecting it to utility supply installations.
Thanks to this kind of solution you are able to enjoy your own house by the lake right from the delivery arrival day and the house can be transported, whenever there's the need, to another destination.
The houses can be used as summer lake or sea houses, residential, offices, social housing, commercial buildings or warehouses. It is also possible to combine a number of buildings into a larger one, setting up a total surface of up to 100 square metres or above.
When choosing a house you may select one of our ready-made designs – as a rule, our houses are 25 to 48 square metres in surface, have a living room with a kitchenette, a bathroom and 1 to 3 bedrooms. You are also welcome to ask us to design and construct a house that will fulfil your individual expectations. In that scenario, you yourself decide upon the house's dimension, the number of bedrooms, the arrangement of walls and room sizes.
The house's roof and wall structures are made of Scandinavian sawn wood – dried, planed and mechanically sorted. The frame that constitutes the structure is normally filled with rock wool – 100 mm thick and 150 mm inside the floor and ceiling. This type of solution makes for a solid and warm wall. Houses insulated this way may be used even in the winter period. Upon request we can also construct a house with a thicker insulation layer.
The steel house frame is made of solid safe anti-corrosive steel profiles. The floor area is closed with a steel sheet from below, which provides protection against vermin and dampness.
The house's roof and walls are covered with vapour and wind barrier foil. The external elevation is finished with a tongue and groove wall board, a steel sheet or a PVC siding. From the interior, we apply tongue and groove panelling boards, MDF panels or PVC. The OSB board or plywood flooring is finished with floor panels, a PVC carpet or floor boards.
The houses are equipped with complete installations: electrical, water, a draining system or electrical heating. They are also equipped with connectors allowing for an easy and fast power connection.
The roof covering is made of a trapezoid metal sheet, panel steel tiles or roofing shingles.
When signing the contract, you choose the facade and finishing materials to be used for the house's walls, floor and roof. We consult with you the arrangement of the rooms and the colours of specified materials and the optional room equipment or furniture.
Each house comes with our standard three-year warranty. All the materials used for their production are new and made by qualified workers.",What are some of the uses for the mobile homes produced?,"The houses can be used as summer lake or sea houses, residential, offices, social housing, commercial buildings or warehouses."
"(Help Me Improve Our Urban Communities In America By Joining My Virtual Organization GRCAM: And Sharing My Book Information)
I created the Grass Roots Community Activist Movement back on a website called Gopher on November 10th, 1991 because I lack support from established black organizations in my city Chicago. The purpose of GRCAM is to form a collective movement that does away with the many divisions within the black community which is counterproductive. This process will begin in Chicago first and spread to other cities once we’re established. We can’t continue to wait on government and corporate America to provide jobs in our community we will teach our clients, members, and our students about Black Wall Street. It’s unacceptable that I have a plan to help improve our inner cities but because I am not affiliated with the political machine in Chicago my ideas are overlooked. cause Help Stop The Genocide In American Ghettos. But glory to God for the internet in the digital age. Since 2001, over 4000 people has been killed in Chicago alone and as a result Chicago is currently the murder capital in America.
I want GRCAM to be a one stop place to network with all of my cyber friends and associates from across America and abroad who are concerned about solving black issues once and for all. GRCAM is a place for my group members to inform the public about your business, your church events, or your cause. Let’s continue to support each other. Children growing up in poverty in America and in Africa are surrounded by lack of opportunity, drugs, and violence. Many GRCAM members have survived these same trials and tribulations such as myself. Now, GRCAM would like to give back to the community by providing goods and services to families that reside in our inner cities. We would like to show the youth in America and in the international community that GRCAM wants to serve urban communities this is what my vision is all about. This is more then about me selling a book my book is just the beginning. I plan to turn my book into a motion picture and also into a prosperous business endeavour.
Our Mission:
To end urban violence, poverty, structural inequality, institutionalized racism, and police brutality within the communities and cities we will serve if given a chance. We believe in educating, empowering, and connecting talented people within and beyond the black community. We promote the creation of economic development, and mentoring programs for at risk youth.
Under the spiritual component we will carry out of the core values of our Christian faith: Faith In Action Network in Chicago, attracting people from diverse communities to form an cooperative alliance with us and build relationships and support initiatives based on my revised book “The Solution For Black America: Reclaiming, Rebuilding, And Restoring The Urban Ghettos In America” second edition on Amazon.com and advocate, model, and celebrate basic human rights.
Our Vision:
To assist single black mothers, single black fathers, and low income two parent families and self-sustaining urban communities through cooperative alliances with similar community organizations. We will work toward the day when every child, youth and adult can feel safe, experiences support and care, and discover ways to use their talent and skills for the greater good of the community.
Our Objective:
To mobilize people across the United States and abroad to purchase my revised book and work with me in getting this book on the best seller list by sharing my book information with your family, friends, place of worship, and at your local community center. The Grass Roots Community Activist Movement is also an organization seeking to add balance in all forms of media and to counteract the negative stereotypes of black males. We are about being pro active in utilizing the positive aspects in the African American community and teach and uplift our black youth through education and community activism. aim is to form a coalition of partners such as Artists, Educators, and Activists who will work in GRCAI.. In order for me to achieve my goal, I need people on my friends list, people in my social groups, and Chicago residents to purchase my revised book.

"The engine is roaring, the smell of burnt petrol fills the air, the heat from the tires hits you in the face, the road stretches out in front of you. The car starts to shake, the chassis starts to twist, you grip the wheel, lick your lips, narrow your eyes. As the lights count down, you feel your breath slow down. Your pulse is starting to race, you feel the car straining at the leash, waiting to be unleashed. The green light comes on and you pop the clutch, shift into first and race for the horizon. The finish line seems so far away. You develop tunnel vision, the world zips by. The speedometer keeps climbing, it is just you and the machine working as one to go as fast as you can dare. Flames shooting out of the exhaust, your car screams across the line. That is drag racing!
The world of drag racing has long fascinated us. Ever since we were kids, we wanted to go fast, go loud and be the first. Everyone has sometime or the other, just held on to the wheel and tried to go as fast as they can, just for bragging rights. The culture of drag racing started a long time ago. On the dry lake beds of California. The world was soon captivated with this concept. The world of V6s and V8s started to rumble and shout. As the sport grew, so did the fascination. Hollywood soon caught this bug and then showcased it in various movies. The idea is simple, just hold on to the steering wheel, keep your foot down, and just beat the other guy. After the Second World War, with the war economy booming, cars were cheap to obtain and also to race. In fact, in the movie Grease’s set in the ’50s, we got to see such a race. John Travolta and his gang tune up an old beater and turn her into Greased Lightening. Because that’s how fast that car can go. You might be wondering how hard is it to go fast, anyone can do it. However you are mistaken, it takes skill, an innate knowledge of the mechanics of the car, the determination to find the ragged edge and the guts to ride it till the end. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Remember, kids, don’t try this at home. Or you will have a tough time explaining to your mother why her car is stuck in a tree.
As the cars evolved, so did the racing. We got to see Mustangs, Corvettes, Camaros, Dodge Charger, Pontiac GTOs, Chevelles, Plymouth Super-Birds, Hemi-Cudas and many more take to the streets and race for glory and prestige. To do the standing quarter-mile in under 10 seconds was the golden pinnacle for these racers. After that the world changed again. We got to see super-charged and turbo-charged racers come in from Japan. Nimble and with huge turbo-boosting, muscle cars had their noses put out of joint. You can see this in the movie Fast and Furious. The first one where Paul Walker goes toe-to-toe with Vin Diesel. A Toyota Supra goes head-to-head with a Dodge Charger R/T. Tires squealing, we got treated to a race that made us reach the edge-of-our-seats.
By the way, if you think that drag racing is just devoted to cars, you are sorely mistaken. Bikes too have played their part in this quest for speed and glory. Most super bikes are tuned and set for race standard. The idea is quite simple, hold the clutch, twist the throttle and hold on for dear life as the front-end lifts. This is best shown in the movie Biker Boyz. A story of biker clubs who rule street-racing. This kind of racing has come to our country. These races take place on abandoned roads far from prying eyes. A word of warning, do not for once think that you can do the same. This kind of street-racing is in fact illegal without the correct permits, licenses, protection and proper bikes or cars.
Now you might be wondering about how to take part in something like this, or even witness this glorious spectacle of worship to the Gods of speed. Easy, just come on down to The Valley Run 2014. This is where you will find hardcore racers and amateurs battle it out. Unleash your speed demons, feel the wind on your face and cross that finish line.",Where did the culture of drag racing originate?,The culture of drag racing started on the dry lake beds of California.

"Would be NHS dental patients urged to seek independent practices
The state of the dental service in Shetland is laid bare in a letter which will be sent to those on a lengthy waiting list.
Hundreds of people are waiting to be registered with the Public Dental Service to be seen for the first time. They will be warned they “will be taken off the list unless they contact the service by mid-July,” according to a press release issued by NHS Shetland this afternoon.
However, contacting the service does not guarantee an appointment.
Those who do get in touch will be encouraged to contact independent dentists who are also able to do NHS work.
The statement reads: “This week we will be writing to people on the NHS Shetland Public Dental Service (PDS) Waiting List to encourage them to consider registering with Independent NHS dentists. This recognises that with the current number of dentists working for our PDS and the number of registered patients the service is already supporting, that patients on our waiting list are unlikely to be seen in the future.
“We are also finding that existing patients are waiting longer than we would want for their treatment and ‘check-ups’.
“Because of this we have agreed to prioritise access to our PDS service for those patients who require additional support; those that have particular clinical needs and for children.”
NHS Shetland chief executive Ralph Roberts said he recognised that the latest development in the under-pressure service would be “frustrating” for those who on the waiting list. But he said it was important to be honest about “the likelihood of the service being able to expand to accommodate them”.
In Lerwick there are 520 people waiting to register, with a further 52 in Brae. NHS Shetland says each of them was written to almost two years ago when the Lerwick Dental Practice opened. It is independent but offers NHS treatment.
Mr Roberts added: “It is also important that our Public Dental Service is able to focus on the patients with most need. We also know that there are alternative dental providers in Lerwick, including those who provide NHS care under the same regulations as our dentists, who have capacity to see patients.
“I would therefore encourage anyone who needs to see a dentist to consider registering with a different dental practice. Meanwhile, I can confirm that the PDS is working hard to maintain a dental service to the more remote areas of Shetland, for example the isles, where an independent service is unlikely to be viable.
“I can also confirm that we are actively working to encourage further independent practices to open in Shetland to provide NHS dental care.”
Overall there are in excess of 19,000 people registered with the Public Dental Service across the isles.
The dental service is continuing its efforts to encourage more independent practices to open and address the shortfall in provision. There are also plans to review the number of dentists in the PDS with a view to employing the maximum number affordable within the budget granted by the Scottish government.
Shetland has a dentist to patient ratio well below the national average. In the isles there is one dentist for every 2,083 patients whereas the Scottish average is one to 1,670.
I seriously considered an NHS list to ease the strain. The 3-day mandatory course (at £900) rather put me off. The course was nothing to do with clinical dentistry; it was about the latest regulations and how to fill in the forms!. After approx 35 years in NHS dentistry, the red tape boys insisted on me doing the course. I will carry on in Private Practice; I do not do bureaucracy and mandated petit regulations well.

"happened at mass earlier…
2015 is almost over. How’s that? Well, my year in twenty fifteen was quiet a roller coaster ride experience and journey of joy, excitement, disappointment, confusion, lost, blessed, and so many emotions to tell. It started to be dramatic since I wasn’t able to get the job at DepEd after all the long wait and hope I put in for that opportunity which led me to disappointment and asked myself what’s next for me then.
Even though learning experience happened to me at the early months of 2015 I was blessed and be part of Mindanao Unity Games (NorthMin) which composed of the different chapters of the community I joined in,Ang Lingkod Ng Panginoon. The said annual sports fest participated by Butuan (the host chapter), Valencia, Malaybalay and of course the Cagayan de Oro. The long hours of ride of butt and back pains are worth it because I did enjoy from the games, the food, the place, the fellowship and meet up of different, new and old faces of brothers and sisters in the community. The three-days stay was truly a remarkable and unforgettable memory that I will forever cherish and bring to me all the days of my life.
On the same month of MUG came the Day of Renewal or the renewal of commitment of the brothers and sisters in Ang Lingkod Ng Panginoon. It means we vow before the Lord and before the brothers and sisters to fully love and serve Him through committing the way of life as a Lingkod committed member. I was reminded of my three letter word (Y-E-S) to the Lord that I shall only love, serve, obey and follow only Him and keep to myself the promises and plans of the Lord to me even how hard it is to be at His side and live out the very life that He wanted me to live. That being a committed member it’s not always like a second venue, fellowship and/or bed of roses but a narrow road towards His Kingdom, seeing Him face to face and worshiping Him together with all the saints, martyrs, missionaries and the people who loves Him.
Of course the following month, June, started our Sister’s Household. We, sisters of 7: Haidi (coordinator/admin), Heidee, Bless, Camille, Melai, Nichole and me, lived under on one roof for three weeks. Household activity for me is always a life changing and a metanoia experience for me because I get to discover, recollect, assess, evaluate, reflect and deepen my relationship with the Lord. Plus, I also get the chance to know and build a deeper relationship with other sisters. We were benefited and blessed by sponsors and donations especially in food and other expenses in the house. What amazed me most was that it’s my 3rd time to join in a sister’s household and 3 weeks of blissful stay it’s like God is telling me that He’s in control over my life although I’ve been overwhelmed with clouds on my mind and doubtful heart.
Then I went back, again, to tutorial which I was never been happy and satisfied for so many reasons. Which lead me to ask myself if ever I’m really into teachings? Should I find other career? That, I don’t know. May God enlighten me and show me His path.
July 16 marked my fascination to Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza aka Yaya Dub in short ALDUB of Eat Bulaga. These two made my year even more exciting, giddy, happy and mixed emotions. They taught me to patiently wait and joyfully appreciate what I have right now. I believe the Lord wanted me to learn through KS that everything happens in the right time at a right reason. I should also do my part and my best to achieve certain goals in my life. Me and my God work hand in hand. To let go and let God do the rest of the work.
My Christian Sexuality Course, CYA Anniversary, Lingkod Christmas Party, Minchu’s goodbye, my brother’s promotion and recommendation,my high school reunion, my family, my relatives, my city, my friends, my country, my life and my God—these are the things my 2015 made of.

Ok app
Ok app. What I don’t understand is that if an app is just simple like I have video shot in portrait mode and want it to crop in squat without any effects then that’s not possible with mute or default background music. I have got video which shows many effects which I don’t want but just want to turn it into squar view so that vertical long height view can be adjusted. This app gives many options this and that but not simple minimalist one option that get your video chane to square mode and then mute or keep default sound. Problem is that even if I use raw format and then select squar it doesn’t crop right way as like we select other effect and then squar. I don’t know who designed such a forceful effects then only change to square mode. Just ok fancy app. Better than stupid iMovie app which is good for nothing complex confusing app in which one cant even no where file is what happening to it where is that going.
Too Many Effects & Filters
I don’t like having filters on my videos/photos. The only thing filters ever seem to do is make your media look less vibrant, and who would want that? My videos are primarily of my pets though, so I like them to be full-color. There seems to be no option to do that. Every setting uses muted-color filters and B&W effects. Blah. I also couldn’t find any decent Christmas music to put over my project. There was one Christmas song but it wasn’t a good one. I’m going to just use GoPro’s other excellent video editing app instead. I think Quik could be useful with additional options added, but it’s not for me at the current state of development. Thanks for letting us use it for free though, even without owning a GoPro.

"Go Easy on the Panic Button, Nostradamus
Posted on January 8, 2018 by Marian Salzman
Originally published on HuffPost.
Anybody who has been in the trends business as long as I have (nearly three decades) has mixed feelings about Nostradamus.
There’s respect for the fact that a French seer born in the boonies in 1503 is still creating buzz five centuries on. There’s envy over his unearthly medieval toolkit, which included not just an actual crystal ball but also necromancy, astrology and a smattering of other Dumbledorean techniques. And there’s a touch of annoyance that people confuse the prophesying he did with what we do, which is trendspotting—an art and science centered on cultural scans and requiring copious legwork (both virtual and real).
Nostradamus is on my mind because his name has become a kind of shorthand for the imminent threat of bad stuff happening. For me, hearing his name more than once in a week is a reminder to check the Doomsday Clock—which, as it turns out, now stands at two and a half minutes to midnight, 30 seconds closer than last year. So, what’s new to worry about this year?
The specter of nuclear war is back as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump trash talk each other and flash their nuclear muscles. The U.S. president’s tweet-warnings about having a “bigger & more powerful” nuclear button than Jong-un and about putting into motion “fire and the fury like the world has never seen” has prompted high-level concerns on both sides of the aisle about fidgety fingers near America’s nuclear launch codes.
Then there’s all that extreme weather, which some attribute to climate change and others to divine punishment. Either way, the ride is getting wild. Speaking of bombs, a “bomb cyclone” is all set to drop on the Northeast, leaving it in white-out conditions and with potential power failures. Meanwhile, cities along the Gulf Coast still struggle to recover from the massive rain dump of Hurricane Harvey in September—the third “500-year flood” in three years. The situation in Puerto Rico is even direr in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Wildfires—which in October raged through Northern California, causing an estimated $3 billion of damage—returned with a fury in the southern part of the state, driven by powerful Santa Ana winds.
Crime is a perennial worry for Americans, but it’s not the mass shootings and other acts of violence that concern us most. Gallup reports that this year again, Americans’ crime worries are topped not by terrorism (30 percent) but by cybercrime—whether it’s having sensitive information stolen (67 percent) or being the victim of identity theft (66 percent). These have been leading concerns since 2009, but cyber-insecurity has been ramped up over the past 18 months by reports of Russian hacking of the 2016 election. If the U.S. electoral system isn’t safe, what hope have we for our retirement funds?
And speaking of finance … Ten years since the first rumblings of the subprime crisis, money is an enduring worry for many Americans. And now experts are issuing warnings that the sequel to the global financial crisis is here. If (when?) the markets for collateralized loan obligations do collapse, as they did in the 2008 financial crisis, today’s ultra-high-frequency electronic trading systems make it likely to happen in milliseconds. That’s scary enough in itself without factoring in the possibility that it could be triggered by hostile individuals or states deliberately hacking into the system as an act of cyberwarfare.
Even if the financial system manages to hold firm, there’s the widely covered prospect of artificial intelligence taking over life as we know it—a prospect that Elon Musk famously sees as a bigger risk than North Korea. In his latest bestseller, Homo Deus, influential author Yuval Noah Harari envisions a future dominated by machines. Since “99 percent of human qualities and abilities are simply redundant for the performance of most modern jobs,” Harari sees computer algorithms outperforming humans across a whole range of work. One consequence could be what Harari calls a “useless class” of people who will be not only unemployed but unemployable.
Even this brief scan of the status quo in early 2018 shows there’s more than enough to get anxious fingers reaching for the panic button. But are things riskier now than in Nostradamus’s time, when life was fraught with plagues, famine and war? Or riskier than a century ago, when a simple cut could lead to a deadly infection and average life expectancy in the U.S. was just 48.4 years for men and 54.0 for women? Our take is that the everyday life of the average American scores pretty low on the old-style threat-o-meter, but instant communication, combined with a fevered 24/7 news cycle, makes for a pretty constant feed of anxiety-inducing information that is addictive and great for ratings. The trend is clear: steadily growing anxiety with occasional spikes of full-on panic.

"History
Starting in 2008, The Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts (OACD, okconservation.org) entered into a first of its kind partnership with Western Farmers Electric Cooperative (WFEC) and The Oklahoma Conservation Commission (OCC) to develop and implement a carbon sequestration program that would benefit the farmers and ranchers of Oklahoma while providing an unparalleled level of certainty to our buyers. Because of a law passed more than 7 years before the launch of this project, the OCC had been given the statutory authority to verify ""carbon credits"" and practices resulting in carbon sequestration. With the possibility of a climate change bill being passed after the election in 2008, no matter the outcome, WFEC was looking to further build their renewable portfolio and the OCC along with OACD approached WFEC with the idea of a pilot project. WFEC would make the initial investment to pay for the credits, OACD would serve as the outreach and aggregation facilitator and OCC would embark on building their verification program.
But in a state where topics like ""carbon credits"" and ""cap and trade"" were not only foreign but controversial, it was the group's focus to keep things local. Each of these three groups were locally led to their core. If WFEC was going to have to purchase credits to offset any emissions, they wanted to purchase as many credits as possible from the members of their own local electric cooperatives. And if the OCC was going to verify these practices generating the credits, then they were going to do so with the help and expertise of local conservation district employees and conservation commission employees alongside their federal partners at the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). And if this little program in Oklahoma was going to make any kind of an impression then we had to offer something that no other market at that time was offering. That's why we decided to make the commitment that every single contract that we signed would be verified every year by local folks that those farmers knew. In addition, WFEC made a large investment with Oklahoma State University's Soil Sciences department to determine actual sequestration rates based not on county-by-county boundaries, but on soil types and management practices to help bolster the program and its legitimacy.
So we embarked on a project that had many of our own members scratching their heads. By the end of the enrollment period, however, we had over 50,000 acres under contract. Not only that, but the one county that has more acres than any other in the project is arguably the most politically conservative county in Oklahoma. To put that statement in perspective, this county with all these acres under contract was the only county in Oklahoma that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not win in 1936. In addition, the verification program that has been so meticulously built by the OCC and the participating conservation districts in Oklahoma has been recognized in international publications alongside some of the most commonly used carbon markets across the globe. That reception led us to build the ECOpass program.
Current Program Vision
While each of the partners continued work on our pilot project, we started the current phase of our program with the question: how do you ""brand"" the idea of carbon credits in a place like Oklahoma?
In conservation, we often joke that we're too ""Green"" for the ""Ag"" groups and too ""Ag"" for the ""Green"" groups. But that position brought us to the point where we needed to start building bridges. We wanted to bridge the divide between rural Oklahomans who are engaged in agriculture and those who are a generation or more removed from the farm. We wanted to build a bridge between urban environmentalists and those who were directly impacting the environment on a grand scale every day. And we even went so far as to want to build a bridge between those who work to fight the changing climate and those who deny that humans have any affect on the climate and its changes whatsoever. Unfortunately, these gaps seem to get wider every day.
That's how we came up with the ECOpass program. In Oklahoma, the heart of the Dust Bowl, a state ravaged by the worst man-made ecological disaster of modern times, a disaster that led to the creation of the modern locally led conservation movement, we created a totally voluntary program that rewards producers who are being good stewards of the land and actively sequestering carbon by bringing them additional financial incentives. Those incentives are provided by every day Oklahomans (or those traveling to Oklahoma) who purchase anywhere from one to twenty ""acres of conservation"" in this great State. We built the bridge of understanding not by using scare tactics but by showing the residents in urban and suburban areas the impact that agriculture producers have on their every day life. How the farming practices used upstream affect their water quality downstream.
Through OACD and the ECOpass program we provide tours for groups or individuals who want to better understand today's agricultural system and farming practices. ECOpass is not just an intangible investment in a metric ton of carbon that you can never see, hold, smell, or touch. It is not a gimmick for those who don't believe that there isn't a carbon problem. It is a way to invest in your neighbor who is working every day to feed and clothe the world and doing it while protecting wildlife habitat, improving air and water quality, and going outside their realm of ""the way we've always done it"" to rebuild the health of the soil that has been stripped of organic matter through decades of hard farming. ECOpass is a way to invest in Oklahomans who are changing their ways in order to clean up and protect your water and protect the soil that each one of us depends on for our very lives.
At OACD, we see the ECOpass as a program that started with the seed of a ""carbon credit"" but then grew into a crop of knowledge that ties those ""city folks"" back to farmers who have committed to better management practices to help protect the environment while increasing soil productivity. When it comes to solving the environmental challenges we face while still trying to feed the world, we all have to put something in to get something out. But for a small investment, the harvest that we are reaping is well worth the little that it took to sow the crop.","What was the primary goal of the partnership between The Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts, Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, and The Oklahoma Conservation Commission in 2008?",The primary goal of the partnership was to develop and implement a carbon sequestration program that would benefit the farmers and ranchers of Oklahoma while providing an unparalleled level of certainty to their buyers.
"The superhero game is a funny specimen indeed. Mostly these games are crap attempts at raping a quick buck from the public with a tie-in related to some blockbuster holiday movie. Rarely are they done well with a few shining moments of awesome like Batman : Arkham Asylum, Spider-Man 2, X-Men Origins : Wolverine and (arguably) The Darkness, but even the crap ones tend to have ONE good thing about them. Usually, everything else in the game is terrible. So anytime I hear there’s a new game with a dude in spandex running around town being all goody-two-shoes, I prepare myself for the worst.
Spiderman : Shattered Dimensions is not tied to a movie or even a comic book series but has a whole new story made for this game. Essentially, the very fabric of space time continueum has been disrupted by a Spidey bad guy called Mysterio which sends ripples through the alternate realities of Spider-Man’s world, affecting the “Amazing Spider-Man” universe, the “Ultimate Spider-Man” universe, the “Noir Spider-Man” universe and the “2099 Spider-Man” universe and your friend, Madam Web, helps the 4 different Spidermen to put things right. Confused yet? To be honest, you tend to forget the story as they tell it because it’s just boring and too complicated to remember really. But story isn’t everything, right?
Spidey : SD is a very linear beat-em-up which came as a huge surprise to me since every other Spidey game has had some sort of free roam, open world feel to it. When you are a character who is largely defined by his mode of transport (web slinging), fans tend to want that ability but at most, you’ll be using it to get over a hole that can not be jumped across. The game layout is done through a series of lengthy boss battles played out as entire levels. After completing a set of 4, another will unlock. You can’t even just pick a universe and go from start to finish which really upset me because the four different universes play so differently and have their own pros and cons.
In the “Amazing Spider-Man” universe, gameplay is very similar to the God of War/Wolverine style beat ’em up with the camera being too slow for the lightning quick attacks of the hero. More often than not, you will find yourself just button mashing to get anywhere with some working results. Using your webs as extensions, you can pound the tar out of all the bad guys relatively easily. Graphically, they’ve touched up everything with cell shading, which actually looks nice and gives rich colour to everything around but best of all, is Neil Patrick Harris as the voice of amazing spiderman. The dialogue is witty and, at times, laugh out loud so fans of the original character won’t be completely let down.
In the “Ultimate Spider-Man” universe, the game seems to switch into a more acrobatic and speedy fighting game. Strangely though, the lazy ass camera issues of the Amazing universe don’t seem to exist in this dimension. The controls feel a bit tighter and you do feel more powerful as enemies tend to die a bit quicker at your hands in this particular game mode. The voice acting is quite good here too with the same voice actors involved with the Ultimate Spider-Man game from the PS2/Gamecube days. The script for this section will make you laugh hard and generally you get the feeling that the makers do favour “Ultimate” over “Amazing”.
Okay, then there’s the “Noir universe”. Based on the new series of comics started in 2008. Set in 1933, Noir Spidey is all about stealth. No new tech gadgetry. Stay in the shadows and take your enemy down silently. Which would be great if the AI wasn’t as dumb as one shoe! You can take down a gangster in full view of everyone and no one seems to care. Accidentally step into a spotlight and suddenly everyone gets pissed off. Also, you are encouraged to use the walls and ceilings to your advantage but the controls just don’t agree. To stick to a wall, you have to push the stick towards it in conjuction with the camera. Which changes because you are moving towards the wall. Needless to say, this universe made me say bad, bad words. Stealth Spidey just doesn’t work and feels like a bad high school experiment.
I have purposely saved the best for last. I have been a big 2099 fan since I got issue #1 when I was a kid so to see a fleshed out 2099 universe almost brought a tear to my eye. This is the mode the game was made for. Everything feels right. The fighting is a bit slower, which it needed to be, the graphics are hyper real and the camera works in your favour for a change. Miguel O’Hara is not a smart alec so his lines are much more straight forward but his voice is a bit over-heroic. Overall, the 2099 levels feel so much better than the others by a long way. Makes you wonder why they didn’t just make a Spider-Man 2099 game.
So here’s yet another superhero game that just doesn’t make the cut. Crap controls and confusing mode changes make the experience so frustrating. If you have wanted to see a 2099 universe realized well, rent this game because it’s the only one we’re going to see. Unfortunately, everything else, barring the voice acting, is terrible in different ways for different reasons. Even hardcore Spidey fans would be hard pressed to find anything to make them keep this title. Things were looking up, with Web of Shadows being a step in the right direction but this just feels cheap and nasty and with the huge amount of titles coming out over the next 2 months, this one can be gratefully forgotten.
– Grant",What are the four different universes in the Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions game?,"The four different universes in the Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions game are the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" universe, the ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" universe, the ""Noir Spider-Man"" universe and the ""2099 Spider-Man"" universe."
"As I was informing you in my previous post, this past Friday I was given the opportunity to go to an assessment day for the Institute of Direct Marketing Summer School. Little did I know that it was going to be such a fun experience and one to learn a lot from irrespective of the outcome.
The day started on a really shy note as I turned up 40 minutes early in my attempt not to be late and beat the traffic, and early I was! Luckily, I was soon joined by a student from Oxford and another one from Cambridge. Talk about competition now! Although they were equally intimidated by me as I am a Master student in the field of Marketing, whereas they had more of an overall business background. Anyway, the day moved on and the room soon filled with students eager to show their best skills and be one of the elected few to benefit from a free week of studying in June in a recognised marketing summer school and potentially get a job from it.
The first task was a short introduction and a unique question to each participant ranging from who you would like to have dinner with to what household object would you mostly likely keep in case of an emergency (note to self: a knife seems like a strange answer, but it is actually very well thought through). Then we were soon divided into 3 groups of 5 and given the task of critically evaluating direct marketing materials from Virgin Media. I must confess, this was the funnest part of the day, not because of the evaluation, but due to the people in my group I got to know and talk to.
The following activities included a one-to-one interview, a numerical and proof reading test, an initiative test and a 5 minute presentation on a topic of my choice.
For this, I chose a few interesting facts about tea and the audience seemed interested and enthusiastic to know about my passion which I deem a sign of success of my presentation skills.The initiative test put me on the spot of a unique situation within the work environment to assess how I would react and I must admit I missed out on a few points but it was also a fun exercise to imagine flying to Brazil for work.
All in all, I feel more prepared to face to tough world of interviewing now as so many students there were sharing. If I will be admitted to the summer school, I’m sure it will be an amazing experience from the little teaser which was the assessment day. If not, it has still been something I learned greatly from.
Well done! I’m sure it will be a great learning experience, even if from the teaser session alone. Also works as a brilliant recruitment drive! Will be keeping my fingers crossed for you 🙂
That’s very nice of you! Thanks 🙂

"1965 Shelby
Cobra
$54,995
PROBUILT CONTEMPORARY COBRA, 427 SIDE-OILER, TOPLOADER 4-SPEED, JAGUAR REAR!!
Not all Cobra replicas are created equal. Take, for example, this Contemporary Cobra, which is widely regarded as one of the most accurate Cobra replicas you can buy, from the round-tube chassis to the exacting proportions of the body. And if you add a 427 side-oiler like the one in this car, you'll end up with a car that very realistically duplicates the original in all the important ways, including the insane performance.
Even basic white paint looks sinister when it's wrapped around the luscious curves of a Cobra roadster. Although it's fiberglass, the detailing on this one is extremely compelling, particularly the hood with its exposed rivets and functional hood scoop. Finish quality is exceptionally good, and despite being built in 1988, this car has seemingly spent most of its life in a bubble, securely stored in a near-perfect environment. As a result, the pearl white paint has an awesome glow that's tough to capture in the studio but looks awesome out in the sunlight. Detailing is, of course, exacting, from the frame-mounted chrome roll bar for the driver to the bumperettes fore and aft to the butch-looking flat black side pipes that look race-ready. And, of course, there's a real sense of pride in driving a Cobra with '427' badges on the side that aren't just for show.
The impressive authenticity continues inside with beautiful blue leather buckets that wrap around and hug you in place and matching door panels with map pockets made of the same fragrant hides. That handsome steering wheel accurately re-creates the original and correct Smiths gauges add to the 1965 look and feel. This Cobra does just fine without a radio, thank you very much, with the side pipes providing all the stereo you'll need when you're hammering the throttle. The forward-canted shifter links to a 4-speed Toploader and the sound of that transmission alone will make gearheads swoon. Simpson race harnesses are not only a good idea for safety but also help hold you in place during aggressive driving and there are beautifully finished carpets that belie this car's racing heritage. A bare trunk doesn't offer much for show but it's big enough to make the Cobra at least a little practical.
Really, if you're going to build a Cobra, why not put an authentic motor in it? The 427 side-oiler in this car cranks out some fairly serious horsepower thanks to a pair of Holley double-pumpers on top of a medium-rise intake and a set of Edelbrock Performer heads. Finned aluminum valve covers and a correct expansion tank add to the vintage look, and this sucker bucks, snarls, and cackles like the real thing. There's a lot of vintage-looking under the hood that adds an authentic vibe to the entire presentation, and with an MSD ignition system and aluminum radiator, it doesn't seem to mind slogging through traffic. The aforementioned Toploader 4-speed feeds a trick Jaguar rear end complete with and inboard disc brakes, while the front suspension is made up of elegant aluminum A-arms that are works of art all by themselves. For safety, there are big Wilwood disc brakes at all four corners and coil-overs holding everything up. Pin-drive Halibrand wheels look just like the originals and wear fat Hankook radials that do a pretty good job of making it sit right.
Highly accurate and beautifully finished, this fantastic Cobra cost a fortune to build. If you appreciate that level of commitment and detail, then this is the Cobra you should put in your garage. Call now!

"Inventor of the water-powered car screamed 'they poisoned me' as he died
Twenty years ago, one of the most controversial engineers of the 20th century died under suspicious circumstances. Stanley Meyer, who was once hailed as a revolutionary innovator after apparently discovering a method which allowed cars to be powered with water, collapsed suddenly while dining with two Belgian investors who were interested in his work.
The 57-year-old had just raised a toast with the men and taken a sip of cranberry juice when he became unexpectedly overwhelmed with pain.
He died just moments later after running out into the parking lot screaming, ""they poisoned me"".
Despite the coroner later denying that Meyer had died from unnatural causes, those who supported the engineer claimed there was foul play involved. Even now, almost two whole decades later, people are still convinced that Meyer had been deliberately silenced by official powers.

Some years before this meeting, Meyer had claimed that he had devised a way for motor vehicles to run on water-based fuel. According to him, the method could be achieved by splitting H20 into its core elements, burning the hydrogen, and then converting the two back into water vapor using a conventional combustion engine.
However, as any scientists out there will know, this would theoretically break the first and second laws of thermodynamics, as it allows for operation as a perpetual motion machine.
What's more, during Meyer's patenting of his invention, he described the molecules in the engine as ""Fuel Cells"". This term is usually reserved for cells that produce electricity - not consume them, as Meyer's did.
Understandably, then, there was a lot of suspicion over whether the process was legitimate, and it was eventually found to be fraudulent during a 1996 Ohio court case. So, if he had been proven to be a phony, why would someone want to kill him?
During the trial, three expert witnesses found that there ""was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all and it was simply using conventional electrolysis,"" which eventually led to Meyer being found guilty of committing ""gross and egregious fraud"". As a result, he was ordered to repay a total of $50,000 to investors.
Essentially, he was outed as a scammer.
However, some people believe that the whole case was a cover-up, and that Meyer's method does work. It's a huge conspiracy theory, of course, but there are folks out there who just don't buy the coroner's verdict that Meyer - who was known to have high blood pressure - died of a cerebral aneurysm.
Credit: YouTube/PESNetwork
As it's been so long since Meyer registered the patents, his inventions are now in the public domain, meaning they're available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment. And yet, nobody has ever pursued the invention.
This should be evidence enough to prove that, as suspected, the method never worked.
Or - for the more dubious theorists out there - perhaps it means that everyone who did try it ended up being surreptitiously silenced... but I suppose we'll never know for",Who was Stanley Meyer and what was his controversial invention?,"Stanley Meyer was one of the most controversial engineers of the 20th century who claimed to have discovered a method which allowed cars to be powered with water.

"The Coleman Archive Volume 1: The Living Tradition
Coleman Heritage Centre CC5; 71 minutes; 2000
Situated in Gurteen, Co. Sligo, the Coleman Heritage Centre has issued a
number of compilation recordings synthesizing the essence of the county’s musical
traditions (shared with neighbouring Leitrim and Roscommon). Prior releases
have consisted of new recordings, such as 1999's estimable The Mountain Road,
which featured a large number of contemporary musicians, including the
Connemara-born accordionist, P.J. Hernon, who has long been based in Sligo, and
the flute-player, Gregory Daly, who lives in the county’s South. Now Hernon and
Daly have combined to produce this unequivocally seminal CD which draws
together a cross-section of recordings held by the Centre’s music archive in
Mount Irwin, spanning the period from the 1940s to the late 1990s.<![if !vml]>
<![endif]>
Since the majority of the thirty-four tracks here were originally recorded privately, understandably there is considerable variation in sound quality, most notably on the opening track by the fiddler Tommy “Clogs” Gallagher (“Clogs” was apparently a nickname he acquired thanks to a tap dance routine which he used to perform on Manhattan cablelink TV). However, as Daly and Hernon note, since most of the musicians were recorded in their own homes, this enhances their music’s sense of relaxation. Additionally, the tracks are not presented in chronological order of recording. So, for instance, “Clogs”, recorded in 1978, is followed by the whistler, Pake Dwyer (1995), and then by Michael Gorman’s nephew, the flute-player, Mike, who was taped in 1959. Rather, the compilers have chosen to offer as much instrumental variety as possible, but remarking reasonably that the fiddle was the key instrument of choice in the area, though being replaced latterly by the flute. Hence, as one would expect, there are few samples of any other instruments - four whistlers, one accordionist, one banjo player and one mouth organist. Intriguingly, the accordionist (Elizabeth Bolger) is one of only two women featured - the compilers recognize the paucity of recordings of women musicians held by the archive - while the banjo player happens to be Larry Redigan, much better known for his fiddling.
Equally, there are few songs - just John Hannon’s My Native Town of Boyle, Jim Murray’s Maid of Sweet Gurteen and Fintan McDonagh’s Collooney Town - while there is also little musical variation. Reels predominate, naturally followed by jigs, with just one slip jig and only one air (and, unusually, the latter played expressively on the mouth organ by Gerry Donagher), while there is not a single hornpipe. However, as Daly and Hernon argue, this should be taken as “a true reflection of what existed in musical terms in the area, and any attempt to balance the material would be to interfere with this reality.” A glance at recordings by older musicians from the Sligo/Roscommon/Leitrim axis does seem to verify this point. The McDonaghs of Ballinafad, for instance, includes just one polka and a single slip jig among a welter of jigs and reels. Fred Finn and Peter Horan’s Music of Sligo features just one hornpipe. Leader’s 1971 LP The Coleman Country Traditional Society is all jigs and reels, barring one slow air. The recordings of Michael Coleman and James Morrison offered far more variety, indeed Harry Bradshaw’s compilation of the latter, The Professor, reveals a fiddler of remarkable versatility. However, both Coleman and Morrison were responding to the needs of both record labels and dance halls. One notable exception, as one would expect, is Josie McDermott, whose repertoire was extremely comprehensive, but then this reflected his extremely broad interest in music of many types.
Neither Coleman nor Morrison is present on The Living Tradition, but the third member of that triumvirate, Paddy Killoran, does appear and is one of its many hidden gems, thanks in part to Kevin Henry. Originally from Doocastle, Henry has been based in the USA since the mid-1950s and recorded Killoran later that decade, playing the reel Kitty Down the Lane, accompanied by the pianist Eleanor Neary. Other notable jewels include: the flute-player, Packie Duignan, recorded in 1978; a wonderful tale about Michael Coleman and his brother Jim, recounted by Jim Donoghue who played as a flute duet with Jim Coleman for some years; an undated recording of Josie McDermott playing The Fermoy Lasses/Cup of Tea with announcement to boot; a 1986 recording of the influential, but rarely recorded fiddler, Martin Wynne; and one from 1959 of the fiddler, Mary Ellen Giblin, a priceless example of the formerly strong tradition of female exponents of the instrument in the region.
Each musician receives a brief biography, some illustrated by archive photographs, and these simply enhance the joy of this recording. For instance, of John Hannon, the compilers note that, “It is a curious fact that in attempting to locate material for an archive collection, often the people who performed most are the hardest to find recorded.” Christy Hannon’s flute was “made from a cartwheel spoke by Michael Connolly, Kilasser, Co. Mayo and donated by him to the Coleman Heritage Centre”. Tommy Cawley “ was for some time in partnership with Michael Coleman in a music teaching business. He made no commercial recordings.” Of Johnny Giblin - “Johnny himself played the whistle, but would always prefer to listen, provided, of course, that the music was of a certain standard!”
Well, this reviewer is absolutely convinced that Johnny’s toes would be a-tapping to this wonderful collection.

"From November 1981 thru February 1983 the Monadnock Folklore Society produced a monthly newsletter. Most of the issues survived, and over the last couple of weeks we’ve scanned them so that they are available on this Web site. The project provided a heartening reminiscence of a bygone era: each issue included a regional folk calendar listing which included the Folkway and Deacon Brodie’s Tavern, as well as an impressive roster of MFS performers including Jean Redpath, George Winston, Alex de Grassi, the Battlefield Band, and many more. Each issue also contained articles and editorials – topics included musicians profiles (Allan Block, Chris Pearne), a foreboding about the demise of contra dancing (When the Set Gets Shorter), a history of Cape Breton music, and more. We were privileged to have Irish novelist Morgan Llywelyn contribute several pieces on Celtic lore. The February 1983 issue gave extensive coverage to the Folkway in celebration of its 8th anniversary. Whether you were an active part of the local folk scene and want to reminisce, or you are more recently tuned in, we think you’ll enjoy browsing these issues).
The transition to the New Year gives us an excuse to review the more immediate past of the last year: MFS produced several well-attended concerts, giving audiences enriching experiences while demonstrating some of the breadth of the genre of “folk music”. It was a phenomenal year for dancing; during the summer the Monday night dance drew record crowds of young people (there is now a Facebook community for the Nelson Dance with 45 members), and experienced dancers have done a good job of being welcoming to newcomers. The Peterborough First Saturday dance is thriving, and there is now a Second Saturday dance in Nelson. Matthew Christian, the recipient of the 2007 Johnny Trombley Scholarship, give a great performance at the opening of the Winter Solstice Party on December 22, doing sets on highland pipes, fiddle, and whistle. This marks the sixth year of the scholarship program.
Looking ahead, in addition to continuing concerts and dances, this Website enables us to more effectively deliver information about events. Many of the pages for events contain music snippets, so you can get a little preview of what’s in store (see the PR page for the Nelson dance with Don Primrose and Heathen Creek, as an example). We are also including calendar information for non-MFS folk music events in the area; while there might be some occassions where there are competing events, it makes this a more useful Web site for those who want to scope out what’s going on.
We now have a way to present articles, profiles of recordings and musicians, and more. For example, we just came across an article about contra dancing in Nelson, published in the Boston Globe in 1969! Fun stuff.
It also provides an additional means of participation for those who are so inclined. Most articles contain a “comments” option which allows users of the Web site to respond to a particular topic with their own insights and observations (you must register on the site to comment, but we won’t sell your email address or turn it over to Homeland Security). We also welcome pictures, video links, and of course, ideas: Write to us.
On behalf of the MFS Board, we wish you prosperity of spirit for the coming year.",What was the purpose of the monthly newsletter produced by the Monadnock Folklore Society from November 1981 to February 1983?,"The monthly newsletter produced by the Monadnock Folklore Society included a regional folk calendar listing, an impressive roster of MFS performers, articles and editorials on various topics.
